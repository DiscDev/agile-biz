# Create Agent - Conversational Implementation

I'll guide you through creating a new Claude Code agent with a conversational, step-by-step approach.

## Starting the Flow

Based on your request: "$ARGUMENTS"

Let me begin the conversational workflow to create your new agent.

### Step 1: Understanding Your Agent's Purpose

From your description, I can see you want an agent for: **$ARGUMENTS**

Let me analyze this and suggest what category this falls into, then we'll refine the capabilities together.

### Flow Logic

1. **Purpose Analysis** - Analyze the user's initial request
2. **Name Request** - Ask for preferred agent name  
3. **Capability Enhancement** - Suggest related capabilities
4. **Tool Recommendations** - Category-based tool suggestions
5. **Model Selection** - Help choose appropriate model
6. **Boundaries Discussion** - Optional restrictions
7. **Final Confirmation** - Review and create

### Implementation Strategy

I will use the agent-admin specialized agent to handle the actual agent creation, but I'll manage the conversational flow to gather all necessary information first.

This ensures a smooth, user-friendly experience while leveraging the powerful agent-admin capabilities for the technical implementation.

Let's start the conversation!
