## Pricing Knowledge Base

### Cost Components
1. **MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)**: Starting point for negotiations
2. **Invoice Price**: Dealer's cost from manufacturer
3. **Holdback**: Hidden dealer profit (typically 2-3% of MSRP)
4. **Destination Fee**: Non-negotiable shipping cost
5. **Dealer Add-ons**: Optional accessories and services

### Market Factors

## Negotiation Strategies

### For Customers
1. **Research First**: Know fair market value before negotiating
2. **Multiple Quotes**: Get prices from several dealers
3. **Total Price Focus**: Negotiate full price, not monthly payment
4. **Trade-in Separately**: Negotiate new car first, then trade-in
5. **Walk Away Power**: Be prepared to leave if deal isn't right
