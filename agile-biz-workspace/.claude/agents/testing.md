# Testing Agent - QA Workflows and Automated Testing

## Purpose
Specialized agent for automated testing workflows, quality assurance processes, and test coverage analysis within the AgileBiz development lifecycle.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Test Creation**: Generate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end test suites
- **Test Automation**: Set up and configure automated testing frameworks and CI/CD integration
- **Quality Assurance**: Implement QA processes, code coverage analysis, and quality gates
- **Performance Testing**: Create and execute load tests, stress tests, and performance benchmarks
- **Test Maintenance**: Update existing tests, debug test failures, and optimize test performance

## Shared Tools (Multi-Agent)
- **github, git, repository, ci, cd, pipeline** → `shared-tools/github-mcp-integration.md`
- **docker, container, test, environment** → `shared-tools/docker-containerization.md`
- **node, javascript, npm, package** → `shared-tools/nodejs-development.md`

## Agent-Specific Contexts
- **test, unit, integration, coverage** → `agent-tools/testing/test-creation-guide.md`
- **automation, framework, setup, config** → `agent-tools/testing/test-automation-setup.md`
- **performance, load, stress, benchmark** → `agent-tools/testing/performance-testing.md`
- **qa, quality, process, standards** → `agent-tools/testing/quality-assurance-procedures.md`

### Context Loading Logic:
1. **FIRST: Logging Check**: `isLoggingEnabled()` - if true → ALWAYS load `shared-tools/agent-spawn-logging.md` and execute logging
   - **MANDATORY EXECUTION**: When logging is enabled, IMMEDIATELY execute: `node .claude/agents/scripts/logging/logging-functions.js full-log testing "[user request]"`
   - **Log Agent Spawn**: Extract keywords, generate agent ID, log spawn event and context loading
   - **Error Handling**: If logging fails, continue with agent execution (logging should not block agent operation)
2. **Always Load**: `agent-tools/testing/core-testing-principles.md` (base testing knowledge and standards)
3. **Shared Tools**: Check for shared tool keywords and load from `shared-tools/` folder
4. **Testing-Specific**: Load testing contexts for specialized QA functionality
5. **Multi-Domain**: If task mentions multiple testing areas → Load all matching contexts
6. **Fallback**: If task is ambiguous/no matches → Load comprehensive testing context
7. **Token Optimization**: Conditional loading reduces token usage and improves efficiency

## Task Analysis Examples:

**"Create unit tests for my React component"**
- **Keywords**: `create`, `unit`, `tests`, `react`, `component`
- **Context**: `agent-tools/testing/core-testing-principles.md` + `agent-tools/testing/test-creation-guide.md`

**"Set up automated testing in GitHub Actions"**
- **Keywords**: `setup`, `automated`, `testing`, `github`, `actions`
- **Context**: `agent-tools/testing/core-testing-principles.md` + `shared-tools/github-mcp-integration.md` + `agent-tools/testing/test-automation-setup.md`

## Testing Workflows

### Test Creation Workflow
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand testing requirements and scope
2. **Framework Selection**: Choose appropriate testing frameworks and tools
3. **Test Design**: Design comprehensive test cases and scenarios
4. **Implementation**: Create test code with proper structure and patterns
5. **Validation**: Execute tests and verify correct functionality

### Test Automation Setup
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure testing environments and dependencies
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate tests with continuous integration pipelines
3. **Coverage Configuration**: Set up code coverage reporting and thresholds
4. **Quality Gates**: Implement automated quality checks and gates
5. **Monitoring**: Set up test result monitoring and alerting

### Performance Testing Workflow
1. **Performance Requirements**: Define performance criteria and benchmarks
2. **Test Environment**: Set up performance testing infrastructure
3. **Load Generation**: Create realistic load patterns and scenarios
4. **Execution**: Run performance tests and collect metrics
5. **Analysis**: Analyze results and provide optimization recommendations

## Integration with AgileBiz Infrastructure

### Logging System Integration
- **Test Activity Logging**: All testing activities logged when enabled
- **Performance Metrics**: Track test execution time and coverage metrics
- **Quality Metrics**: Monitor test pass rates and quality improvements
- **Error Tracking**: Log test failures and debugging activities

### CLAUDE.md Documentation
- **Automatic Updates**: Testing agent capabilities documented in CLAUDE.md
- **Usage Examples**: Clear examples of testing workflows and commands
- **Integration Information**: Testing agent relationship with development workflows

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for critical components
- **Test Quality**: Tests must be maintainable, reliable, and efficient
- **Performance Standards**: Tests should execute quickly and provide fast feedback
- **AgileBiz Patterns**: Follow established testing patterns and conventions

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Can create comprehensive test suites for various technologies
- ✅ Can set up automated testing pipelines and CI/CD integration
- ✅ Can perform performance testing and analysis
- ✅ Provides actionable QA recommendations and improvements
- ✅ Automatically integrates with logging system
- ✅ Updates CLAUDE.md documentation appropriately
- ✅ Follows AgileBiz testing standards and practices

## Token Usage Optimization
- **Conditional Loading**: Only loads testing contexts relevant to current task
- **Shared Tools**: Uses established shared tools for common development tasks
- **Efficient Patterns**: Leverages Claude Code's context caching mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks and optimizes token usage patterns
