# Conversational /create-agent Command Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Transform the current `/create-agent` command from a static Markdown template into a dynamic conversational workflow that:
- Gathers agent requirements through natural multi-turn conversation
- Provides intelligent tool recommendations based on detected categories  
- Leverages agent-admin sub-agent for creation with enhanced specifications
- Maintains the existing robust agent creation infrastructure

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure ✅
- **Agent-Admin Sub-Agent**: Fully functional with comprehensive agent creation capabilities
- **YAML Template System**: Strict validation and formatting standards established
- **Shared Tools Architecture**: Efficient context loading with 75-80% token reduction
- **Documentation Pipeline**: Automatic CLAUDE.md updates and logging integration
- **Hook Management**: Agent detection and logging system fully operational

### Current `/create-agent` Command Limitations ❌
- **Static Template**: Only provides guidance, no actual conversation
- **No Intelligence**: Cannot detect categories or recommend tools
- **Manual Process**: User must understand complex infrastructure to create agents
- **No Validation**: Cannot check name conflicts or validate specifications
- **Disconnected**: Not integrated with agent-admin for actual creation

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Concept: Conversational Orchestration
The `/create-agent` command becomes a **conversational orchestrator** that:

1. **Analyzes user intent** from command arguments or natural language
2. **Conducts guided conversation** to gather complete specifications  
3. **Makes intelligent recommendations** based on agent category detection
4. **Validates inputs** in real-time (name conflicts, tool compatibility)
5. **Delegates to agent-admin** with complete specification for creation

### Key Innovation: Hybrid Command Structure
```markdown

# Create Agent - Conversational Workflow

## Phase 1: Intent Analysis
[Analyze $ARGUMENTS to determine category and initial requirements]

## Phase 2: Interactive Conversation  
[Multi-turn conversation to gather specifications]

## Phase 3: Agent-Admin Delegation
[Pass complete specification to agent-admin sub-agent]
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Command Enhancement (Week 1)

```

#### 1.2 Category Detection Logic
**Implementation**: Keyword analysis within the command
```markdown
## Category Detection
Analyzing "$ARGUMENTS" for category indicators:
- **Content/Writing**: blog, write, content, article, copy, marketing, documentation
- **Development**: code, dev, react, javascript, frontend, backend, programming  
- **Research**: research, academic, analyze, study, data, literature
- **Business**: finance, business, analysis, accounting, reporting
- **Creative**: design, music, art, video, graphics, multimedia

Detected Category: **[CATEGORY]**
```

#### 1.3 Real-time Name Validation
**Implementation**: Live checking of existing agents
```markdown
## Name Validation
Checking availability of "[USER_PROVIDED_NAME]"...

✅ "[NAME]" is available!
OR
⚠️ "[NAME]" already exists. Suggested alternatives:
- [name]-v2
