# Simple /create-agent Command Implementation Plan

## Summary
Replace the current static `/create-agent` command with a conversational workflow that guides users through agent creation and hands off to agent-admin for implementation.

**Core Principle**: Keep it simple - one command, natural conversation, delegate to existing agent-admin.

## What We Have (Good)
✅ **Agent-admin sub-agent**: Fully functional, creates agents perfectly  
✅ **Existing infrastructure**: YAML validation, hooks, logging all work
✅ **Shared tools system**: Efficient, proven architecture

## What We Need (Simple)
❌ **Conversational interface**: Guide users through requirements gathering  
❌ **Smart recommendations**: Based on detected agent purpose  
❌ **Real-time validation**: Name conflicts, input validation

## Simple Implementation

### Phase 1: Enhanced Command (2 days)
**File**: `.claude/commands/create-agent.md`

**New Structure**:
```markdown
---
description: "Interactive agent creation through guided conversation"
model: opus
---

# Create Agent - Interactive Conversation

## Intent Analysis
Request: "$ARGUMENTS"

Let me guide you through creating your agent:

**What would you like to name your agent?**
(Use lowercase-with-dashes, e.g., 'weather-helper')
```

### Phase 2: Conversation Flow (3 days)

**Simple 5-Step Conversation**:
1. **Agent Name** + availability check
2. **Purpose** + category detection (content/dev/business/research)  
3. **Model Selection** (haiku/sonnet/opus with recommendations)
4. **Tool Selection** (smart recommendations based on category)
5. **Confirmation** + agent-admin handoff

**Example Flow**:
```
User: /create-agent blog writing helper
Command: Based on "blog writing helper", I'll help you create a content agent.

What would you like to name it? (suggest: blog-helper)
User: blog-helper

Command: ✅ "blog-helper" is available!

What's the main purpose?
User: Help write and edit blog posts with SEO optimization

Command: Great! For content agents, I recommend:
• Context7 MCP (research & documentation) ✓
• Supabase MCP (content storage)

Which Claude model?
• Haiku (fast/simple) 
• Sonnet (recommended for writing) ✓
• Opus (complex reasoning)
User: sonnet

Command: Perfect! Here's your agent:
**Name**: blog-helper
**Purpose**: Help write and edit blog posts with SEO optimization  
**Model**: Claude Sonnet
**Tools**: Context7 MCP, Supabase MCP

Create this agent? (yes/no)
User: yes

Command: ✅ Creating blog-helper agent...
[Delegates to agent-admin]
✅ Done! Restart Claude Code to see your new agent.
```

### Phase 3: Agent-Admin Integration (1 day)

**Simple Specification Format**:
```json
{
  "agent_name": "blog-helper",
  "description": "Help write and edit blog posts with SEO optimization", 
  "model": "sonnet",
  "category": "content_creation",
  "shared_tools": ["Context7 MCP", "Supabase MCP"],
  "keywords": ["blog", "writing", "content", "seo"]
}
```

**Task Delegation**:
```markdown
Creating your agent using agent-admin...

[TASK]:
Create new agent with specification: [JSON]

Tasks:
1. Create agent file with correct YAML
2. Add relevant shared tools only  
3. Update hooks and logging
4. Update CLAUDE.md documentation
```

## Key Features (Simple)

### 1. Category Detection
**Simple keyword matching**:
- **Content**: writing, blog, content, marketing, copy
- **Development**: code, dev, programming, software, build
- **Business**: analysis, finance, data, reporting
- **Research**: research, academic, analysis, study

### 2. Smart Tool Recommendations  
**Category-based suggestions**:
- **Content**: Context7 MCP, Supabase MCP
- **Development**: Context7 MCP, GitHub MCP, Git, Docker
- **Business**: Context7 MCP, Supabase MCP, AWS  
- **Research**: Context7 MCP

### 3. Real-time Validation
**Name conflict checking**:
```markdown
Checking "blog-helper"...
✅ Available!
OR  
⚠️ "blog-helper" exists. Try: blog-writer, content-helper, blog-assistant
```

### 4. Model Recommendations
**Simple guidance**:
- **Haiku**: Simple, repetitive tasks
- **Sonnet**: Most agents (recommended default)
- **Opus**: Complex reasoning, analysis

## Files Changed

### New/Modified Files
1. `.claude/commands/create-agent.md` - Enhanced conversational command
2. `.claude/agents/agent-tools/agent-admin/conversational-workflow-management.md` - Updated context

### No New Infrastructure 
- ❌ No new JSON config files
- ❌ No new directories  
- ❌ No complex tool categories system
- ❌ No external processes

**Keep it simple**: Use existing agent-admin capabilities with enhanced specification format.

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Natural conversation** vs reading complex documentation
- **Smart recommendations** based on detected purpose
- **Real-time validation** prevents errors
- **Single session** - no complex state management

### Technical
- **Leverages existing infrastructure** - no breaking changes
- **Simple implementation** - enhanced command + agent-admin context update
- **No over-engineering** - minimal new components
- **Proven patterns** - builds on working agent-admin system

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Core Implementation
- **Days 1-2**: Enhanced create-agent.md command structure
- **Days 3-5**: Conversation flow and category detection  
- **Day 6**: Agent-admin integration enhancement
- **Day 7**: Testing and validation

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Natural conversation flow works
- ✅ Category detection is accurate  
- ✅ Name validation prevents conflicts
- ✅ Agent-admin creates agents correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing system

## Why This Approach

### Simple vs Complex
❌ **Complex**: Tool categories JSON, specialized tools, external processes  
✅ **Simple**: Enhanced command + existing agent-admin + smart recommendations

### Proven vs Experimental  
❌ **Experimental**: New infrastructure, complex state management
✅ **Proven**: Build on existing agent-admin capabilities with enhancements

### Focused vs Feature-Heavy
❌ **Feature-Heavy**: Specialized tools, custom integrations, complex workflows
✅ **Focused**: Core agent creation with smart guidance

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Uses existing, proven agent-admin system
- No breaking changes to infrastructure  
- Simple conversation flow
- Minimal new code

### Medium Risk ⚠️  
- Conversation state management across turns
- Category detection accuracy

### Mitigation
- **State Management**: Complete in single session, no persistence needed
- **Category Detection**: Simple keyword matching with fallbacks

## Conclusion

This simple approach provides 80% of the benefits with 20% of the complexity:

✅ **Natural user experience** through guided conversation  
✅ **Smart recommendations** based on detected purpose
✅ **Builds on proven infrastructure** (agent-admin system)
✅ **No over-engineering** or complex new systems  
✅ **Fast implementation** (1 week vs 4 weeks)

The key insight: We don't need complex tool categories or specialized tool integration. The existing agent-admin system already handles agent creation perfectly - we just need a better front-end conversation to gather requirements and format them properly.
