# AgileBiz Workspace - Project Rebuild

## CRITICAL: Reference-Only Folder
**NEVER MODIFY agile-ai-agents-v7.0.0/ - THIS IS REFERENCE ONLY**
- agile-ai-agents-v7.0.0/ contains the source system for reference
- This folder must remain untouched and unmodified
- Only READ from this folder for analysis and understanding
- All rebuild implementation work goes in agile-biz/ and .claude/ folders only
- All rebuild planning work goes in rebuild-planning/ folder only

## Rebuild Project Structure
- **Reference Source**: agile-ai-agents-v7.0.0/ (READ ONLY - do not modify)
- **Planning Documents**: rebuild-planning/ (all analysis, strategy, and planning docs)
- **Implementation Target**: agile-biz/ (rebuild destination for business logic)
- **Claude Integration**: .claude/ (commands, agents, hooks, settings)

## üö® CRITICAL: Workspace Path Enforcement üö®
**ABSOLUTE WORKSPACE PATH**: `/Users/phillipbrown/No-iCloud-Folder/AgileBiz/agile-biz-workspace/`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PATH RULES - NEVER VIOLATE ‚ö†Ô∏è:
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: All work in `/Users/phillipbrown/No-iCloud-Folder/AgileBiz/agile-biz-workspace/`
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Never create or use `/Users/phillipbrown/No-iCloud-Folder/AgileBiz/agile-bz-workspace/`
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Never create or use any variation of "agile-bz-workspace"
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Never create "agile-bz-workspace" in any location
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Always use full absolute paths when creating files
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Always double-check paths contain "agile-biz-workspace" (not "agile-bz-workspace")
- ‚úÖ **VALIDATION**: Before any file operation, verify the path includes "agile-biz-workspace"

### üîç Common Path Errors to Avoid:
- `agile-bz-workspace` (WRONG - missing 'i' in 'biz')
- `agile-bz-` (WRONG - truncated)
- Any variation that is NOT exactly `agile-biz-workspace`

**IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY CREATE THE WRONG PATH, IMMEDIATELY STOP AND MOVE FILES TO THE CORRECT LOCATION**

## Workspace Rules
1. NEVER modify files in agile-ai-agents-v7.0.0/
2. Only read/analyze agile-ai-agents-v7.0.0/ for reference
3. All planning documents go in rebuild-planning/
4. All implementation goes in agile-biz/ and .claude/ folders
5. Stay in planning mode until explicitly told to implement
6. Create comprehensive planning documents before any implementation

## Folder Purposes
- **rebuild-planning/**: Strategy docs, analysis reports, architecture plans, migration guides
- **agile-biz/**: Business logic, core application, project structure
- **.claude/**: Claude Code integration (commands, agents, hooks, statusline)
- **agile-ai-agents-v7.0.0/**: Reference system for analysis and understanding

### Agent Usage Examples

When you want to delegate specific tasks to agents, use these patterns:

- **"Have developer agent create a React component"** ‚Üí Spawns developer agent
- **"DevOps agent deploy this to AWS"** ‚Üí Spawns devops agent
- **"Developer agent implement authentication"** ‚Üí Spawns developer agent
- **"Get devops agent to set up monitoring"** ‚Üí Spawns devops agent
- **"Agent-admin create a new testing agent"** ‚Üí Spawns agent-admin
- **"Finance agent create a budget for Q1"** ‚Üí Spawns finance agent
- **"Have finance analyze our investment portfolio"** ‚Üí Spawns finance agent
- **"Content-writer create a blog post about digital marketing"** ‚Üí Spawns content-writer agent
- **"Have content writer optimize this article for SEO"** ‚Üí Spawns content-writer agent
- **"Content-writer adapt this blog for social media"** ‚Üí Spawns content-writer agent

### Agent Context Architecture

All agents use a shared tools architecture for efficiency:
- **Shared Tools**: Docker, GitHub, AWS, Git, Context7 MCP, Supabase MCP
- **Agent-Specific Contexts**: Loaded based on keywords and task requirements
- **Token Optimization**: 75-80% reduction in context duplication
- **Agent Logging**: Optional logging system tracks agent spawning and context usage

## Git Commit Messages

When creating git commits, **ALWAYS** use the following attribution format instead of the default Claude Code message:

```
[Your commit message here]

**AgileBiz‚Ñ¢** - Created by Phillip Darren Brown (https://github.com/DiscDev)
```

**Do NOT use** the default Claude Code attribution (`ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code`).

- Add to memory naming convention for folders and files is lower case with dashes.  Example: my-example.md
