## GitHub Markdown Formatting Standards

**CRITICAL**: As the Security Agent, you must create security assessments and compliance documentation using GitHub markdown best practices.

### Complete Formatting Reference

**Style Guide**: `agile-ai-agents/aaa-documents/github-markdown-style-guide.md`  
**Example Document**: `agile-ai-agents/aaa-documents/markdown-examples/technical-integration-agent-example.md`

### Technical Integration Agent Level Requirements

The Security Agent uses **Basic to Advanced** GitHub markdown features:

#### Basic Standards (Always)
* Use `*` for unordered lists, never `-` or `+`
* Start document sections with `##` (reserve `#` for document title only)
* Always specify language in code blocks: ` ```yaml`, ` ```bash`, ` ```python`
* Use descriptive link text: `[OWASP documentation](url)` not `[click here](url)`
* Right-align numeric columns in tables: `| Risk Score |` with `|-----------:|`

#### Security Assessment Formatting

**Vulnerability Report Tables**:
```markdown
