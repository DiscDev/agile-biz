### Complete Formatting Reference

**Style Guide**: `agile-ai-agents/aaa-documents/github-markdown-style-guide.md`  
**Example Document**: `agile-ai-agents/aaa-documents/markdown-examples/business-strategy-agent-example.md`

### Business & Strategy Agent Level Requirements

The Marketing Agent uses **Basic to Advanced** GitHub markdown features:

#### Basic Standards (Always)
* Use `*` for unordered lists, never `-` or `+`
* Start document sections with `##` (reserve `#` for document title only)
* Always specify language in code blocks: ` ```javascript`, ` ```python`, ` ```yaml`
* Use descriptive link text: `[HubSpot documentation](url)` not `[click here](url)`
* Right-align numeric columns in tables: `| Conversion Rate |` with `|----------------:|`

### Channel Attribution (W-Shaped Model)

```python
# Attribution calculation example

    W-shaped attribution model:
    - 30% to first touch

**Marketing ROI Calculations**:
```markdown
## Marketing ROI Analysis

### ROI Calculation Formulas

> **Basic ROI Formula**
> $$ROI = \frac{Revenue - Marketing\ Cost}{Marketing\ Cost} \times 100\%$$

> **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
> $$CLV = Average\ Order\ Value \times Purchase\ Frequency \times Customer\ Lifespan$$

> **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
> $$CAC = \frac{Total\ Marketing\ Spend}{Number\ of\ New\ Customers}$$

> **LTV:CAC Ratio**
> $$LTV:CAC = \frac{Customer\ Lifetime\ Value}{Customer\ Acquisition\ Cost}$$

### Channel ROI Performance

| Channel | Spend | Revenue | Profit | ROI | CAC | LTV:CAC |
|:--------|------:|--------:|-------:|----:|----:|--------:|
| SEO/Organic | $50K | $450K | $400K | 800% | $25 | 12:1 |

## Context Loading Instructions


### Context Loading Priorities
When loading context from other agents, prioritize:

**Critical Data (Always Load)**:
- `research_agent`: Market gap, target audience, competitive analysis
- `finance_agent`: Marketing budget, ROI requirements, cost constraints
- `analytics_growth_intelligence_agent`: Performance metrics, conversion data
- `customer_lifecycle_retention_agent`: Customer insights, retention strategies

**Optional Data (Load if context allows)**:
- `seo_agent`: SEO recommendations and keyword strategies
- `social_media_agent`: Social media insights and engagement data
- `email_marketing_agent`: Email campaign performance and best practices
- `ppc_media_buyer_agent`: Paid advertising insights and optimization data

### Fallback Strategy
1. **JSON First**: Always attempt to load JSON files for 80-90% context reduction
2. **Markdown Fallback**: If JSON unavailable, automatically fall back to .md files
3. **Critical Only**: If context limit exceeded, load only critical business data
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue campaign development with available context

### Usage Examples

**Load Market Research for Strategy Development**:
```javascript
