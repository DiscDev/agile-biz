const RateLimiter = require('redis-sliding-rate-limiter');

class APIRateLimiter {
  constructor(redisClient) {
    this.redis = redisClient;
    this.limiters = new Map();
  }

  async checkLimit(userId, endpoint, tier = 'standard') {
    const limits = this.getLimitsForTier(tier);
    const key = `rate_limit:${userId}:${endpoint}`;
    
    const limiter = new RateLimiter({
      redis: this.redis,
      window: limits.window, // 1 hour
      limit: limits.requests
    });

    try {
      const result = await limiter.check(key);
      
      return {
        allowed: result.remaining > 0,
        remaining: result.remaining,
        resetTime: result.resetTime,
        limit: limits.requests
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Rate limiter error:', error);
      // Fail open for system resilience
      return { allowed: true, remaining: 999, limit: limits.requests };
    }
  }

  getLimitsForTier(tier) {
    const limits = {
      anonymous: { requests: 100, window: 3600 },
      standard: { requests: 1000, window: 3600 },
      premium: { requests: 5000, window: 3600 },
      enterprise: { requests: 10000, window: 3600 }
    };
    
    return limits[tier] || limits.standard;
  }
}

// Middleware implementation
const rateLimitMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  const userId = req.user?.id || req.ip;
  const tier = req.user?.subscription_tier || 'anonymous';
  const endpoint = req.route.path;

  const result = await rateLimiter.checkLimit(userId, endpoint, tier);

  // Add rate limit headers
  res.set({
    'X-RateLimit-Limit': result.limit,
    'X-RateLimit-Remaining': result.remaining,
    'X-RateLimit-Reset': result.resetTime
  });

  if (!result.allowed) {
    return res.status(429).json({
      error: {
        code: 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED',
        message: 'Too many requests. Please try again later.',
        retryAfter: result.resetTime - Date.now()
      }
    });
  }

  next();
};

    withRateLimit: '2-5ms per request',
    percentageIncrease: '1-2%'
  },
  
  memoryUsage: {
    redisMemory: '50MB for 100K active users/hour',
    applicationMemory: '5MB for rate limiter cache',
    totalIncrease: '<1% of current usage'
  },
  
  networkTraffic: {
    redisRequests: '2 additional requests per API call',
    bandwidthIncrease: '0.1% of total bandwidth',
    redundancy: 'Redis cluster for high availability'
  }
};
```
