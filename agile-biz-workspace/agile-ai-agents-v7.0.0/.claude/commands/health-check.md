# System Health Check

Perform comprehensive system health analysis to identify issues and ensure optimal performance.

## Health Check Process

1. **System Overview**
   - Check project structure integrity
   - Verify dependencies and versions
   - Assess configuration status
   - Review resource utilization

2. **Performance Metrics**
   Use Task tool with logger_agent to gather:
   - Response times and latency
   - Memory usage patterns
   - CPU utilization
   - Disk I/O statistics
   - Network performance

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   Use Task tool with devops_agent for:
   - Outdated dependencies check
   - Security vulnerability scan
   - License compliance review
   - Version compatibility matrix

4. **Code Health**
   Use Task tool with optimization_agent for:
   - Code complexity metrics
   - Test coverage analysis
   - Documentation completeness
   - Technical debt assessment

5. **Infrastructure Status**
   - Database connections
   - API endpoint availability
   - External service integrations
   - Cache performance

## Health Report Format

```
üè• SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK REPORT
=============================

‚úÖ Overall Health: [Healthy/Warning/Critical]
   Score: [85/100]

üìä Performance Metrics
   Response Time: 124ms (avg)
   Memory Usage: 512MB/2GB
   CPU Usage: 15% (avg)
   Uptime: 99.95%

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Detected (3)
   1. [HIGH] Outdated dependency: express@4.17.1
   2. [MEDIUM] Missing test coverage in /api/auth
   3. [LOW] Deprecated API usage in logger.js

üîß Recommendations
   1. Update dependencies (npm update)
   2. Add tests for authentication module
   3. Migrate to new logging API

üìà Trends
   - Memory usage increased 12% over last week
   - Response times improved by 8%
   - Error rate stable at 0.02%

Next health check: /health-check --detailed
