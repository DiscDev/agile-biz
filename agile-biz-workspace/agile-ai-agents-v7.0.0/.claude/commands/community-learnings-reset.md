## Learning Quality Assessment and Cleanup

### Learning Validation Framework
```markdown
## Learning Quality Standards

### High-Value Learning Criteria
**Content Quality**:
- [ ] **Clear Problem Definition**: Problem is well-defined and understandable
- [ ] **Actionable Solution**: Solution is specific and actionable
- [ ] **Validated Results**: Success has been measured and verified
- [ ] **Replicable Process**: Others can follow the approach successfully
- [ ] **Comprehensive Context**: Sufficient context for understanding applicability

**Impact Assessment**:
- [ ] **Measurable Benefit**: Learning provides quantifiable improvement
- [ ] **Broad Applicability**: Learning can be applied to multiple scenarios
- [ ] **Time Savings**: Learning reduces time required for similar challenges
- [ ] **Quality Improvement**: Learning improves output quality
- [ ] **Risk Reduction**: Learning reduces project or operational risks

### Learning Cleanup Process
**Phase 1: Quality Assessment**
- Review each learning against quality criteria
- Identify learnings that need updating or expansion
- Mark outdated or incorrect learnings for removal
- Find duplicate or overlapping content for consolidation

**Phase 2: Content Enhancement**
```bash
# Automated quality checks
#!/bin/bash

# Check for incomplete learnings
grep -r "TODO\|TBD\|FIXME" learnings/

# Find learnings without validation
grep -L "Success Metrics\|Evidence\|Validation" learnings/**/*.md

# Identify outdated content (over 2 years old)
find learnings -name "*.md" -mtime +730 -exec echo "Potentially outdated: {}" \;

# Check for broken links
find learnings -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "http" {} \; | \
while read file; do
  echo "Checking links in $file"
  grep -o "https\?://[^)]*)?" "$file" | while read url; do
    curl -s --head "$url" | grep -q "200 OK" || echo "BROKEN: $url in $file"
  done
done
```

**Phase 3: Content Consolidation**
- Merge related learnings that address similar challenges
- Create learning series for complex topics
- Establish clear learning hierarchies and dependencies
- Update cross-references and related learning links

### Outdated Learning Management
**Criteria for Removal**:
- **Technology Obsolescence**: Learning applies to deprecated technologies
- **Process Changes**: Learning contradicts current best practices
- **Factual Errors**: Learning contains incorrect information
- **Superseded Content**: Learning replaced by better alternatives
- **No Validation**: Learning never proved effective

**Archival Process**:
```bash
# Create archive structure
mkdir -p learnings-archive/{deprecated,superseded,historical}

# Archive outdated learnings with metadata
archive_learning() {
  local learning_file=$1
  local reason=$2
  local archive_dir="learnings-archive/$reason"
  
  # Add archival metadata
  cat > "$archive_dir/$(basename $learning_file)" << EOF
---
ARCHIVED: $(date)
REASON: $reason
ORIGINAL_PATH: $learning_file
---

$(cat "$learning_file")
EOF
  
  # Remove from active learnings
  rm "$learning_file"
}
```
```
