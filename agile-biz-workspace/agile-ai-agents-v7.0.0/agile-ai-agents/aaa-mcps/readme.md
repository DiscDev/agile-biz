# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup Guides

This directory contains setup guides for various MCP servers that enhance the capabilities of AgileAiAgents' specialized agents.

## What are MCP Servers?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are external integrations that give Claude desktop direct access to tools and services. When configured, agents can perform actions directly in these services rather than just providing instructions.

## How to Use MCP Servers

1. **Choose an MCP** based on your project needs
2. **Follow the setup guide** in the corresponding file
3. **Configure credentials** in your .env file
4. **Restart Claude Desktop** after configuration
5. **Agents will automatically** use MCP when available

## Important Notes

- MCP servers only work with **Claude Desktop** (not web version)
- Each MCP requires specific **credentials** (API keys, tokens)
- Configuration is done in Claude Desktop's **settings**
- Agents will fall back to instructions if MCP is not available

## Security Considerations

- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use .env files for sensitive information
- Rotate API tokens periodically
- Only enable MCPs you actively use

## Troubleshooting

If an MCP isn't working:
1. Verify you're using Claude Desktop
2. Check credentials are correct
3. Restart Claude Desktop
4. Review the specific setup guide
5. Check MCP server logs
