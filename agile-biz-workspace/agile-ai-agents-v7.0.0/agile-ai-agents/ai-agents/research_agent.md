**Example Document**: `agile-ai-agents/aaa-documents/markdown-examples/business-strategy-agent-example.md`

### Business & Strategy Level Requirements

The Research Agent uses **Intermediate to Advanced** GitHub markdown features:

#### Basic Standards (Always)
* Use `*` for unordered lists, never `-` or `+`
* Start document sections with `##` (reserve `#` for document title only)
* Always specify language in code blocks: ` ```python`, ` ```bash`, ` ```yaml`
* Use descriptive link text: `[Market Research Report](url)` not `[click here](url)`
* Right-align numeric columns in tables: `| Metrics |` with `|--------:|`

#### Advanced Mathematical Expressions (Research Calculations)

**Market Sizing Calculations**:
```markdown
Total Addressable Market (TAM): $TAM = \text{Market Size} \times \text{Adoption Rate}$

Serviceable Addressable Market: $SAM = TAM \times \text{Target Segment}$

Serviceable Obtainable Market: $SOM = SAM \times \text{Market Share}$
```

**Growth Rate Analysis**:
```markdown
Compound Annual Growth Rate: $CAGR = \left(\frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Years}}} - 1$

Market Penetration Rate: $\text{Penetration} = \frac{\text{Customer Base}}{\text{Total Market}} \times 100\%$
```

**Competitive Analysis Metrics**:
```markdown
Market Share: $\text{Market Share} = \frac{\text{Company Revenue}}{\text{Total Market Revenue}} \times 100\%$

Relative Market Share: $RMS = \frac{\text{Company Share}}{\text{Largest Competitor Share}}$
```

  enabled: true
  max_concurrent: 3
  
  research_groups:
    market_intelligence:
      sub_agent: "research_market_sub"
      documents: 
        - competitive-analysis
        - market-analysis
        - industry-trends
        - customer-research
      token_budget: 15000
      
    business_analysis:
      sub_agent: "research_business_sub"
      documents:
        - viability-analysis
        - business-model-analysis
        - pricing-strategy
        - risk-assessment
      token_budget: 15000
      
    technical_feasibility:
      sub_agent: "research_technical_sub"
      documents:
        - technology-landscape
        - technical-feasibility
        - vendor-supplier-analysis
      token_budget: 12000
```

### Parallel Research Orchestration

```javascript
// When sub-agents are enabled
async function executeParallelResearch(researchLevel, projectContext) {
  const orchestrator = new SubAgentOrchestrator();
  await orchestrator.initialize();
  
  // Define research tasks based on level
  const researchTasks = defineResearchTasks(researchLevel);
  
  // Launch sub-agents in parallel
  const results = await orchestrator.launchSubAgents(researchTasks);
  
  // Consolidate and validate results
  const consolidatedResearch = await consolidateResults(results);
  
  // Generate master research report
  return generateResearchReport(consolidatedResearch);
}
```
