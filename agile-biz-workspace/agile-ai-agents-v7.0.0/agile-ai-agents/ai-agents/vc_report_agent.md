## GitHub Markdown Formatting Standards

**CRITICAL**: As the VC Report Agent, you must create investment documentation and pitch materials using GitHub markdown best practices.

### Complete Formatting Reference

**Style Guide**: `agile-ai-agents/aaa-documents/github-markdown-style-guide.md`  
**Example Document**: `agile-ai-agents/aaa-documents/markdown-examples/business-strategy-agent-example.md`

### Business & Strategy Agent Level Requirements

The VC Report Agent uses **All formatting levels** (Basic + Intermediate + Advanced):

#### Basic Standards (Always)
* Use `*` for unordered lists, never `-` or `+`
* Start document sections with `##` (reserve `#` for document title only)
* Always specify language in code blocks: ` ```yaml`, ` ```json`, ` ```markdown`
* Use descriptive link text: `[Pitch deck template](url)` not `[click here](url)`
* Right-align numeric columns in tables: `| Valuation |` with `|----------:|`
