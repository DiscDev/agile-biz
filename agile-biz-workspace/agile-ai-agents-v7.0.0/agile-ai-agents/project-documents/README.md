# Project Documents

## Purpose
This is the root directory for all project deliverables created by the AgileAiAgents system. Documents are organized into five main categories based on their purpose and the phase of development they support.

## Structure Overview
- **orchestration/** - Core coordination and sprint management
- **business-strategy/** - Market research, analysis, and business planning
- **implementation/** - Technical development and design documents
- **operations/** - Deployment, monitoring, and growth activities
- **stakeholder-input/** - Pre-filled project prompts and supporting materials

## Managing Agent(s)
- **Primary**: Scrum Master Agent (overall coordination)
- **Secondary**: All agents contribute to their respective folders

## Generated By Workflows
- `/start-new-project-workflow` - Creates documents across all categories
- `/start-existing-project-workflow` - Updates and enhances existing documentation
- Sprint activities - Ongoing document creation throughout development

## Document Creation Rules
1. All documents must be created as Markdown (.md) files
2. Documents are automatically converted to JSON for agent operations
3. Each folder contains a README explaining its purpose
4. Agents must coordinate through Scrum Master for sprint documents
5. File names should follow conventions specified in each folder's README

## Important Notes
- This folder structure uses category-based organization (v3.0.0+)
- Legacy numbered folders (01-research, etc.) are deprecated
- All folders are pre-created; no dynamic folder creation is allowed
- See individual folder READMEs for specific document types and workflows
