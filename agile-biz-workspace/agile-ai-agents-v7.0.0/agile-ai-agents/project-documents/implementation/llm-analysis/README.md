# LLM Analysis

## Purpose
This folder contains AI/LLM integration analysis, prompt engineering documentation, and language model optimization strategies created by the LLM Agent.

## Managing Agent(s)
- **Primary**: LLM Agent
- **Secondary**: API Agent, Coder Agent

## Generated By Workflows
- `/start-new-project-workflow` - Phase 3 (Design): Creates LLM integration strategy
- `/start-existing-project-workflow` - Phase 4 (Implementation): Updates AI capabilities
- AI feature planning
- LLM optimization cycles

## Document Types
- LLM integration strategies
- Prompt engineering guidelines
- Model selection analysis
- Fine-tuning specifications
- Token optimization plans
- Response quality metrics
- AI safety protocols
- Cost optimization strategies

## File Naming Conventions
- Pattern: `[type]-[feature/model]-[date].md`
- Examples: 
  - `strategy-llm-integration-2025-01.md`
  - `prompts-customer-service-bot-2025-02.md`
  - `analysis-model-selection-2025-01.md`

## When Documents Are Created
- During Phase 3 of new project workflow (Design phase)
- When planning AI features
- For LLM cost optimization
- During prompt engineering sessions
