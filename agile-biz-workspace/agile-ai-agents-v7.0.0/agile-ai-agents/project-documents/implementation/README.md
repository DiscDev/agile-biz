# Implementation

## Purpose
This category contains all technical design, development, and implementation documents that guide the actual building of the project.

## Managing Agent(s)
- **Primary**: Various technical agents (see subdirectories)
- **Secondary**: Coder Agent (coordination across technical areas)

## Generated By Workflows
- `/start-new-project-workflow` - Phase 3-4: Requirements, design, and technical planning
- `/start-existing-project-workflow` - Phase 4-5: Technical analysis and enhancements
- Sprint activities: Ongoing technical documentation

## Document Types
- Requirements and specifications
- System architecture and design
- API documentation
- Security assessments and plans
- Testing strategies and reports
- Technical implementation details
- LLM and AI integration plans
- Environment configurations
- Technical documentation
