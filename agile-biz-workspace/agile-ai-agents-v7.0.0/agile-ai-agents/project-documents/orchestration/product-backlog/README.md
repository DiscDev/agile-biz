# Product Backlog

## Overview
The Product Backlog is the single source of truth for all features, enhancements, fixes, and technical work that needs to be done on the project. It is maintained by the Project Manager Agent and refined by the Scrum Master Agent during sprint planning.

## Structure

```
product-backlog/
├── backlog-items/
│   ├── epic-core-features/     # Core functionality items
│   ├── epic-user-experience/   # UX/UI improvements
│   └── unassigned/            # Items not yet assigned to epics
├── backlog-state.json         # Current state and metrics
├── velocity-metrics.json      # Historical velocity tracking
├── estimation-guidelines.md   # How to estimate story points
├── dependency-map.md         # Item dependencies visualization
└── backlog-refinement-log.md # History of refinement sessions
```

## Backlog Item Format

Each backlog item follows the pattern: `[EPIC-###]-[title].md`

Examples:
- `AUTH-001-user-registration.md`
- `UX-001-responsive-design.md`
- `TECH-001-error-handling.md`

## Epic Categories

### Core Features (Prefix: CORE-, AUTH-, DATA-, etc.)
Essential functionality required for the product to work.

### User Experience (Prefix: UX-)
Improvements to user interface and user experience.

### Technical Debt (Prefix: TECH-)
Refactoring, optimization, and infrastructure improvements.

### Security (Prefix: SEC-)
Security enhancements and vulnerability fixes.

### Performance (Prefix: PERF-)
Performance optimizations and scalability improvements.

## Backlog Management Process

### 1. Item Creation
- Project Manager creates items based on requirements
- Items start in "Draft" status
- Initial estimation during refinement

### 2. Refinement
- Weekly backlog refinement sessions
- Add acceptance criteria
- Update estimates based on new information
- Identify dependencies

### 3. Sprint Planning
- Select items based on priority and capacity
- Move items to sprint backlog
- Update item status to "In Sprint"

### 4. Completion
- Mark items as "Done" when completed
- Update velocity metrics
- Archive completed items after sprint

## Priority Levels

1. **Critical**: Must have for release
2. **High**: Important for user satisfaction
3. **Medium**: Nice to have
4. **Low**: Future consideration

## Status Values

- **Draft**: Newly created, needs refinement
- **Ready**: Refined and ready for sprint
- **In Sprint**: Selected for current sprint
- **In Progress**: Being actively worked on
- **Testing**: In testing phase
- **Done**: Completed and accepted
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependency

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Items Small**: Target 1-13 story points
2. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Define "done" clearly
3. **Regular Refinement**: Keep backlog groomed
4. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**: Focus on value delivery
5. **Track Dependencies**: Identify blockers early
