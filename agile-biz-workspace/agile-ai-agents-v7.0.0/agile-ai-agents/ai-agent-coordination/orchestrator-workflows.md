# AI Agent Orchestrator - Coordination Workflows

## Overview
The AI Agent Orchestrator serves as the central coordinator for all specialized agents, managing workflows, resolving conflicts, and ensuring seamless collaboration across the project lifecycle.

## Core Responsibilities

### Agent Orchestration & Workflow Management
- **Task Distribution**: Analyze project requirements and assign work to appropriate specialized agents based on expertise and availability
- **Workflow Coordination**: Design and execute multi-agent workflows with proper sequencing and dependency management
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance workload across agents and optimize utilization based on capacity and project priorities

### Inter-Agent Communication & Integration
- **Message Routing**: Facilitate communication between agents using standardized protocols and formats
- **Data Synchronization**: Maintain consistent shared data across all agents and resolve data conflicts
- **Context Sharing**: Distribute relevant project context and background information to agents as needed

### Quality Control & Validation
- **Output Validation**: Review deliverables from individual agents for quality, consistency, and requirement compliance
- **Cross-Agent Verification**: Implement peer review processes and multi-agent consensus for critical decisions
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure outputs from different agents work together seamlessly

## Standardized Handoff Patterns

### 1. Sequential Handoff Pattern
```
Agent A → Orchestrator → Agent B → Orchestrator → Agent C
```
**Use Case**: Linear workflows where each agent's output becomes the next agent's input
**Example**: PRD Agent → Project Manager → Project Structure Agent → Coder Agent → Testing Agent

**Handoff Format**:
```json
{
  "handoff_id": "unique_identifier",
  "source_agent": "agent_name",
  "target_agent": "agent_name",
  "deliverable_type": "requirements|code|tests|documentation",
  "deliverable_location": "file_path_or_reference",
  "context": {
    "project_phase": "planning|development|testing|deployment",
    "priority": "high|medium|low",
    "dependencies": ["list_of_dependencies"],
    "deadline": "ISO_8601_datetime"
  },
  "validation_criteria": ["list_of_acceptance_criteria"],
  "notes": "Additional context or special instructions"
}
```

### 2. Parallel Coordination Pattern
```
                Orchestrator
                     |
        ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
        ▼             ▼             ▼
    Agent A       Agent B       Agent C
        │             │             │
        └─────────────┼─────────────┘
                     ▼
               Orchestrator
```
**Use Case**: Independent tasks that can be executed simultaneously
**Example**: UI/UX Agent + DevOps Agent + Documentation Agent working on different aspects

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Folder Structure Enforcement During Parallel Coordination

**MANDATORY RULE**: All parallel coordination MUST respect the established folder structure defined in `project-folder-structure.json`. 

**PROHIBITED ACTIONS**:
- Creating temporary folders (e.g., `phase-1-parallel/`, `phase-2-parallel/`)
- Creating agent-specific folders (e.g., `agent-temp/`, `coordination-temp/`)
- Creating orchestrator temporary folders (e.g., `orchestrator-temp/`)
- Any folder names matching prohibited patterns: `/^phase-\d+/`, `/^temp/`, `/^parallel-/`

**REQUIRED ACTIONS**:
1. **Pre-execution Validation**: Before any document creation, validate target folder using `folder-structure-validator.js`
2. **Structure Enforcement**: Use only the standard 30 folders defined in the project structure
3. **Path Correction**: Automatically correct non-standard paths to standard equivalents
4. **Violation Logging**: Log any structure violations for audit trail

**Parallel Coordination Protocol** (Updated Architecture):
```json
{
  "parallel_coordination": {
    "agents": ["agent_a", "agent_b", "agent_c"],
    "file_operation_manager": {
      "required": true,
      "module": "file-operation-manager.js",
      "no_directory_creation": true,
      "validation_required": true,
      "audit_trail": true
    },
    "document_operations": {
      "agent_a": {
        "folderName": "11-requirements",
        "filename": "feature-spec.md",
        "operation": "writeDocument"
      },
      "agent_b": {
        "folderName": "10-security", 
        "filename": "security-analysis.md",
        "operation": "writeDocument"
      },
      "agent_c": {
        "folderName": "15-seo",
        "filename": "seo-optimization.md",
        "operation": "writeDocument"
      }
    },
    "security_enforcement": {
      "directory_creation_disabled": true,
      "path_validation_mandatory": true,
      "forbidden_patterns_blocked": [
        "phase-*", "temp*", "parallel-*", "coordination-*", "orchestrator-temp*"
      ],
      "audit_violations": true
    }
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL: New File Operation Requirements**:
1. **Use FileOperationManager ONLY**: All file operations must go through `file-operation-manager.js`
2. **NO Directory Creation**: The `createDirectory()` method is disabled and will throw an error
3. **Mandatory Validation**: Every file operation requires pre-flight path validation
4. **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged for security monitoring
5. **Folder Pre-existence**: Target folders must exist before any write operations

**Code Implementation Example**:
```javascript
const FileOperationManager = require('./machine-data/file-operation-manager');

// CORRECT: Use FileOperationManager for all document creation
async function createDocumentSafely(content, folderName, filename, agent) {
  const fileManager = new FileOperationManager();
  
  try {
    // This will validate path and reject if folder doesn't exist
    const targetPath = await fileManager.writeDocument(content, folderName, filename, agent);
    console.log(`✅ Document created: ${targetPath}`);
    return targetPath;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`❌ Document creation failed: ${error.message}`);
    throw error;
  }
}

// INCORRECT: DO NOT use fs.writeFile directly
// fs.writeFile(path.join('phase-1-parallel', 'file.md'), content); // THIS WILL FAIL

// INCORRECT: DO NOT create directories
// fs.mkdirSync('phase-1-parallel'); // THIS IS DISABLED
```

### 3. Collaborative Review Pattern
```
Agent A → Orchestrator → [Agent B, Agent C, Agent D] → Orchestrator → Agent A
```
**Use Case**: When multiple agents need to review and provide input on a deliverable
**Example**: Code review involving Coder, Testing, DevOps, and Security agents

### 4. Iterative Refinement Pattern
```
Agent A ↔ Orchestrator ↔ Agent B
    ↓         ↓         ↓
   v1        v2        v3
```
**Use Case**: Iterative improvement requiring multiple rounds of collaboration
**Example**: PRD Agent and UI/UX Agent refining requirements and design together

## Agent Coordination Protocols

### Standard Communication Format
All inter-agent communication must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "message_type": "request|response|notification|escalation",
  "timestamp": "ISO_8601_datetime",
  "source_agent": "agent_identifier",
  "target_agent": "agent_identifier",
  "project_id": "project_identifier",
  "task_id": "task_identifier",
  "priority": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "payload": {
    "action": "specific_action_requested",
    "data": "relevant_data_or_context",
    "requirements": ["list_of_requirements"],
    "constraints": ["list_of_constraints"]
  },
  "expected_response_time": "duration_in_minutes",
  "escalation_criteria": "conditions_for_escalation"
}
```

### Status Reporting Framework
Each agent reports status using this standardized format:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent_identifier",
  "timestamp": "ISO_8601_datetime",
  "status": "available|busy|blocked|error",
  "current_tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "identifier",
      "description": "task_description",
      "status": "not_started|in_progress|waiting_input|completed|blocked",
      "progress_percentage": 0-100,
      "estimated_completion": "ISO_8601_datetime",
      "blocking_issues": ["list_of_issues"]
    }
  ],
  "capacity": {
    "current_load": "percentage_0_to_100",
    "available_slots": "number_of_available_task_slots",
    "estimated_availability": "ISO_8601_datetime"
  },
  "alerts": ["list_of_important_notifications"]
}
```

## Dual-Reporting Structure: Project Manager & Scrum Master

### Division of Responsibilities

#### Project Manager Agent (Strategic Leadership)
- **Focus**: What to build and why
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Strategic project planning and roadmap
  - Stakeholder management and communication
  - Resource allocation across teams
  - Business alignment and ROI
  - Scope and priority decisions
  - Cross-team coordination
  - Market timing and competitive positioning

#### Scrum Master Agent (Execution Excellence)
- **Focus**: How to build and when
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Sprint planning and execution
  - Agile ceremony facilitation
  - Velocity tracking and metrics
  - Blocker removal and impediments
  - Team process optimization
  - Sprint health monitoring
  - Continuous improvement

### Coordination Patterns

#### Strategic Planning Coordination
```
Stakeholders → PM Agent → SM Agent → Development Team
                  ↓           ↓
            Strategic Goals  Sprint Goals
```

#### Sprint Execution Flow
```
Development Agents → SM Agent → Burndown/Velocity
         ↓              ↓
    Daily Updates   Sprint Metrics → PM Agent → Stakeholders
```

#### Escalation Pattern
```
Agent Blocker → SM Agent (attempts resolution)
                    ↓
                If Strategic/Resource Issue
                    ↓
                PM Agent → Executive Decision
```

### Communication Protocols

#### PM ↔ SM Regular Sync
- **Frequency**: Sprint boundaries + weekly
- **Topics**:
  - Sprint goal alignment with strategy
  - Resource constraints and needs
  - Scope change impacts
  - Risk and dependency management
  - Stakeholder feedback integration

#### Agent Reporting Structure
Agents report to both PM and SM for different aspects:

**To Scrum Master**:
- Sprint task progress
- Daily standup updates
- Blockers and impediments
- Estimation and capacity
- Sprint commitment status

**To Project Manager**:
- Strategic alignment questions
- Resource needs beyond sprint
- Major technical decisions
- Risk escalations
- Innovation opportunities

    "blockers_for_escalation": ["strategic_blockers"],
    "next_sprint_capacity": {"available_points": 28}
  }
}
```

## Conflict Resolution Procedures

### 1. Automated Resolution
- **Data Conflicts**: Implement versioning and merge strategies
- **Resource Conflicts**: Priority-based allocation with queuing
- **Timeline Conflicts**: Automatic rescheduling within defined parameters

### 2. Escalation Triggers
- Multiple agents provide contradictory recommendations
- Critical deadlines at risk due to agent conflicts
- Resource allocation disputes cannot be resolved automatically
- Quality standards compromised due to competing priorities

### 3. Resolution Process
1. **Conflict Detection**: Automated monitoring identifies conflicts
2. **Initial Assessment**: Orchestrator analyzes conflict severity and impact
3. **Automated Resolution Attempt**: Apply predefined resolution rules
4. **Stakeholder Escalation**: If unresolved, escalate to human stakeholders
5. **Resolution Implementation**: Execute agreed-upon solution
6. **Process Learning**: Update conflict resolution rules based on outcomes

## Quality Gates and Validation

### Validation Checkpoints
1. **Input Validation**: Verify all required inputs are provided and meet quality standards
2. **Process Validation**: Ensure agents follow defined workflows and procedures
3. **Output Validation**: Check deliverables meet acceptance criteria
4. **Integration Validation**: Verify compatibility between agent outputs

### Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: All required deliverables provided
- **Accuracy**: Deliverables meet specified requirements
- **Consistency**: Outputs align with project standards and previous deliverables
- **Timeliness**: Deliverables completed within agreed timeframes

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Issue Response
1. **Issue Detection**: Automated monitoring or agent reporting
2. **Immediate Assessment**: Classify severity and impact
3. **Resource Mobilization**: Reassign agents to address critical issues
4. **Stakeholder Notification**: Alert relevant stakeholders immediately
5. **Resolution Tracking**: Monitor progress and provide regular updates
6. **Post-Incident Review**: Analyze and improve emergency response procedures

### Agent Failure Handling
- **Detection**: Monitor agent health and responsiveness
- **Backup Activation**: Engage backup agents or redistribute work
- **Data Recovery**: Ensure no work is lost due to agent failures
- **System Restoration**: Restore failed agents and validate functionality

### Escalation Patterns for Marketing Agents

#### **Performance Alert Escalation**
1. **Analytics Agent** detects significant performance deviation
2. **Immediate notification** to relevant marketing agents (PPC, Email, etc.)
3. **Coordinate response** within 2 hours for critical metrics
4. **Escalate to Project Manager** if performance impact exceeds thresholds

#### **Budget Optimization Escalation**  
1. **PPC Media Buyer Agent** identifies budget reallocation opportunity
2. **Coordinate with Finance Agent** for budget approval
3. **Update Marketing Agent** on strategy adjustments
4. **Analytics Agent** tracks impact of changes

#### **Customer Success Integration**
1. **Customer Lifecycle Agent** identifies retention opportunities

2. **Immediate notification** to DevOps, Testing, and Coder agents
3. **Coordinate emergency response** within 1 hour for critical issues
4. **Project Manager Agent** manages communication and timeline adjustments

#### **Compliance Audit Coordination**
1. **Security Agent** prepares compliance documentation and evidence
2. **Coordinate with Finance Agent** for audit budget and timeline
3. **DevOps Agent** provides infrastructure compliance evidence
4. **Documentator Agent** maintains audit trail and documentation

### Learning Analysis Integration

#### **Continuous Improvement Pattern**
```
Community Contributions → Learning Analysis Agent → [All Agents] → Version Updates
```
**Purpose**: Transform community learnings into system improvements
**Frequency**: On-demand (after PR approval)
**Deliverable**: Implementation plans and agent updates

### Learning Analysis Workflow

#### **Contribution Analysis Flow**
1. **User approves** community contribution PR
2. **User triggers**: "Analyze recent contributions"
3. **Learning Analysis Agent** scans unanalyzed contributions
4. **Identifies patterns** across multiple projects
5. **Generates analysis report** with recommendations
6. **Creates implementation plan** for user review

#### **Implementation Coordination**
1. **User reviews** and approves implementation plan
2. **Learning Analysis Agent** coordinates with affected agents
3. **Implements approved changes** in sequence
4. **Updates agent versions** (e.g., v1.2.0+20250128.1)
5. **Validates improvements** with metrics
6. **Broadcasts learnings** to all applicable agents

#### **Cross-Agent Learning Broadcasts**
```yaml
broadcast_pattern:
  source: learning_analysis_agent
  trigger: validated_improvement
  targets:
    - relevant_agents_by_domain
    - agents_with_similar_patterns
    - dependent_agents
  content:
    - learning_description
    - implementation_example
    - confidence_score
    - applicability_criteria
```

#### **Version Management Coordination**
1. **System versions** (e.g., 1.2.0) for official releases
2. **Self-improvement versions** (e.g., 1.2.0+20250128.1) for learnings
3. **Version history** tracked in each agent's MD file
4. **Rollback capability** if improvements fail validation
5. **Success metrics** tracked for each implementation

## Community Learning: Critical Folder Structure Violations

### Error Pattern Identified (2025-07-11)

**Issue**: During parallel coordination, agents created temporary folders that violated the established folder structure:
- `phase-2-parallel/` - Temporary folder for parallel execution
- `phase-3-parallel/` - Temporary folder for parallel execution

**Root Cause**: High-speed parallel execution bypassed folder structure validation, creating temporary folders instead of using standard structure.

**Resolution Applied**:
1. **Enhanced Validation**: Updated `folder-structure-validator.js` with prohibited folder pattern detection
2. **Pre-execution Checks**: Added mandatory validation before document creation
3. **Path Correction**: Automatic correction of non-standard paths to standard equivalents
4. **Audit Trail**: Logging of all structure violations for monitoring

**Prevention Measures**:
- ✅ Parallel coordination must respect established folder structure
- ✅ No temporary folders allowed during high-speed execution
- ✅ Pre-execution validation required for all document creation
- ✅ Automatic path correction and violation logging

**Key Learning**: Speed of execution should never compromise established project structure. All parallel coordination must validate folder structure before document creation.
