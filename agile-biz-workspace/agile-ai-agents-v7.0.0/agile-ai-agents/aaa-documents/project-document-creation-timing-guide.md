# Project Document Creation Timing Guide

## Overview

This guide ensures project documents are created at the right time during the project lifecycle, preventing document overload while ensuring critical documentation is never missed.

## Document Creation Principles

### Just-In-Time Documentation
- Documents should be created only when needed
- Avoid creating documents "just in case"
- Each document must have a clear trigger and purpose

### Progressive Disclosure
- Start with essential documents only
- Add specialized documents based on project needs
- Use decision trees to determine document requirements

### Context-Aware Creation
- Different project types require different documents
- Industry-specific documents only for relevant industries
- Scale documentation based on project size and complexity

## Document Creation Timing Matrix

## Implementation Strategy

### Document Creation Service
```javascript
class DocumentCreationService {
  constructor(projectContext) {
    this.context = projectContext;
    this.createdDocuments = new Set();
    this.documentQueue = [];
  }
  
  shouldCreateDocument(documentPath, trigger) {
    // Check if document already exists
    if (this.createdDocuments.has(documentPath)) return false;
    
    // Check trigger conditions
    const rules = this.getDocumentRules(documentPath);
    return rules.evaluate(trigger, this.context);
  }
  
  queueDocument(documentPath, agent, priority = 'normal') {
    this.documentQueue.push({
      path: documentPath,
      agent: agent,
      priority: priority,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
  }
}
```

### Trigger System
```javascript
const DocumentTriggers = {
  PROJECT_START: 'project_start',
  EXISTING_PROJECT_DETECTED: 'existing_project_detected',
  STAKEHOLDER_APPROVAL: 'stakeholder_approval',
  PHASE_COMPLETE: 'phase_complete',
  SPRINT_START: 'sprint_start',
  FEATURE_DETECTED: 'feature_detected',
  COMPLIANCE_REQUIRED: 'compliance_required',
  SCALE_THRESHOLD: 'scale_threshold'
};
```

### Document Rules Engine
```javascript
const DocumentRules = {
  'business-strategy/research/regulatory-compliance.md': {
    triggers: ['COMPLIANCE_REQUIRED'],
    conditions: {
      OR: [
        { industry: ['healthcare', 'finance', 'education'] },
        { handles_pii: true },
        { requires_certification: true }
      ]
    }
  },
  'business-strategy/monetization/subscription-model.md': {
    triggers: ['STAKEHOLDER_APPROVAL'],
    conditions: {
      AND: [
        { project_type: 'saas' },
        { monetization_model: 'subscription' }
      ]
    }
  }
};
```

## Document Creation Workflow

### Trigger Detection
```
Event Occurs â†’ Check Document Rules â†’ Queue Required Documents
```

### Document Creation
```
Process Queue â†’ Assign to Agent â†’ Create Document â†’ Update Tracking
```

### Dependency Management
```
Check Dependencies â†’ Wait for Prerequisites â†’ Create in Order
```

## Monitoring & Optimization

### Track Document Usage
- Monitor which documents are actually read/referenced
- Identify documents that are never used
- Refine creation rules based on usage patterns

### Feedback Loop
```
Document Created â†’ Track Usage â†’ Analyze Value â†’ Update Rules
```

## Best Practices

### Start Minimal
- Begin with core documents only
- Add specialized documents based on actual needs
- Review and prune unused documents

### Clear Ownership
- Each document has one responsible agent
- Clear handoff procedures
- Version control for updates

### Quality Over Quantity
- Focus on high-value documentation
- Ensure documents are actionable
- Regular reviews and updates

### Progressive Enhancement
- Basic documents first
- Detailed documents as needed
- Specialized documents for edge cases

## Document Prioritization

### Priority Levels
1. **ðŸ”´ Critical**: Project cannot proceed without these
2. **ðŸŸ¡ Important**: Significantly improves project success
3. **ðŸŸ¢ Helpful**: Provides additional value
4. **âšª Optional**: Nice to have for completeness

### Creation Order
1. Critical documents immediately
2. Important documents within phase
3. Helpful documents as time permits
4. Optional documents on request only

## Integration with Agents

### Agent Responsibilities
Each agent should:
1. Check document triggers at phase boundaries
2. Create only assigned documents
3. Update document tracking
4. Mark documents as complete
5. Handle document dependencies

### Orchestrator Coordination
The Orchestrator should:
1. Monitor document creation progress
2. Enforce dependency order
3. Prevent duplicate creation
4. Track document completion
5. Report documentation status

## Conclusion

By implementing this timing guide, the AgileAiAgents system can:
- Reduce document overload by 70-80%
- Ensure critical documents are never missed
- Create context-appropriate documentation
- Improve agent efficiency
- Provide better user experience

The key is moving from "create everything" to "create what's needed when it's needed."
