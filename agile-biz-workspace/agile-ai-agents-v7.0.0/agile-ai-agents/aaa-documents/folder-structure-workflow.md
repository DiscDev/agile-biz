# Document Creation Workflow (16-Phase Process)

## Overview
This guide outlines the 16-phase workflow for creating all project documents in the AgileAiAgents system. It shows the optimal order, parallelization opportunities, and agent coordination required for efficient document generation.

## Workflow Principles

### Execution Strategy
- **Sequential where necessary**: Foundation documents must come first
- **Parallel where possible**: Independent domains can execute simultaneously  
- **Phase dependencies**: Later phases require earlier phase outputs
- **Agent coordination**: Multiple agents can work in parallel during peak phases

### Time Optimization
- **Sequential Execution**: 65-95 hours (one agent at a time)
- **Parallel Execution**: 36-52 hours (5-7 agents working simultaneously)
- **Time Savings**: 40-45% reduction with proper parallelization

## The 16 Phases

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Foundation Dependencies
1. **Phase 1** (Foundation) → **Everything**
   - All subsequent work requires project brief and architecture understanding

### Strategic Dependencies  
2. **Phase 4** (Strategic Planning) → **All Technical & Business Development**
   - Sets direction for all implementation work

### Requirements Dependencies
3. **Phase 8** (Requirements) → **All Implementation**
   - Technical work cannot begin without requirements

### Implementation Dependencies
4. **Phase 11** (Implementation) → **All Operations**
   - Operations require working system

## Maximum Parallelization Requirements

### Agent Resources
- **5-7 agents** working simultaneously during peak phases
- **Clear handoff protocols** between phases
- **Shared context management** for cross-agent collaboration
- **Quality gates** at phase transitions

### Coordination Points
- Phase 1-2: Sequential foundation building
- Phase 3-6: Maximum parallelization (5-7 agents)
- Phase 7-9: Mixed sequential/parallel
- Phase 10-11: High parallelization
- Phase 12-13: Sequential deployment
- Phase 14-16: Maximum parallelization for growth

## Optimization Opportunities

### Cross-Phase Overlap
Some Phase N+1 activities can begin before Phase N is 100% complete:
- Start research (Phase 3) when project brief is ready
- Begin requirements (Phase 8) with strategic direction
- Prepare deployment (Phase 12) during late development

### Agent Specialization
Agents can prepare next-phase work while waiting:
- Research Agent can draft templates during analysis
- PRD Agent can outline structure during strategy
- DevOps Agent can prepare environments early

### Iterative Refinement
Early phases can be refined while later phases execute:
- Update research with new findings
- Refine requirements based on implementation
- Adjust strategies based on market response

### Conditional Execution
Some advanced phases only execute based on needs:
- Skip investment planning if self-funded
- Defer advanced analytics for MVPs
- Postpone optimization until traffic warrants

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Indicators
- **Time Reduction**: 40-45% vs sequential execution
- **Agent Utilization**: 70-80% during peak phases
- **Handoff Success**: <5% rework due to miscommunication
- **Quality Gates**: 95% pass rate at phase transitions

### Document Quality
- **Completeness**: All required sections filled
- **Consistency**: Cross-document alignment
- **Accuracy**: Verified facts and data
- **Actionability**: Clear next steps defined

### Coordination Success
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents active
- **Dependencies Met**: No blocking delays
- **Context Sharing**: Efficient information flow
- **State Management**: Accurate progress tracking

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Scrum Master Agent
1. Monitor phase transitions
2. Coordinate parallel agent activation
3. Track dependencies and blockers
4. Ensure quality gates are met
5. Maintain sprint document registry

### For Individual Agents
1. Check phase dependencies before starting
2. Coordinate with parallel agents in same group
3. Update document registry on completion
4. Signal phase completion to orchestrator
5. Prepare handoff documentation

### For Project Manager
1. Plan resource allocation by phase
2. Monitor critical path progress
3. Identify optimization opportunities
4. Manage phase gate approvals
5. Track overall timeline adherence
