## Optimization Guidelines

### When to Use Maximum Parallelization
- Large projects with many independent components
- Time-critical deliveries
- Well-defined, low-coupling architectures

### When to Reduce Parallelization
- Highly coupled legacy systems
- Limited token budgets
- Projects requiring sequential knowledge building

### Optimal Configuration by Project Type

# Microservices
sub_agents:
  research_phase: { groups: 4 }
  sprint_execution: { max_parallel_coders: 5 }
  project_analysis: { categories: 10 }
