## Cost Monitoring Commands

### Real-Time Tracking
```bash
# Check current session cost
/cost

# Detailed breakdown
/cost --detailed

# Example output:
Session Cost Summary
Duration: 2h 34m
Total tokens: 145,230
Input tokens: 89,421 ($2.68)
Output tokens: 55,809 ($2.79)
Total cost: $5.47
```

### Cost Checkpoints
Create cost awareness habits:
```bash
# Start of session
/cost  # Baseline

# Every 2-3 hours
/cost  # Monitor growth

# Before major operations
/cost  # Pre-research baseline

# After expensive operations
/cost  # Impact assessment
```

## Phase-Specific Optimization

### 1. Discovery Phase (15-20% tokens)

**Cost Drivers**:
- Multiple clarifying questions
- Iterative refinements
- Approval cycles

**Optimization Strategies**:
```bash
# EXPENSIVE: Multiple rounds of clarification
You: "I want to build something for tasks"
AI: "What kind of tasks?"
You: "Work tasks"
AI: "What specific problems?"
[... 10 more exchanges ...]

# OPTIMIZED: Clear initial description
You: "I want to build a task management app for remote software teams 
that integrates with GitHub and Slack, focusing on sprint planning 
and async communication."
AI: [Proceeds with targeted questions]
```

**Best Practices**:
- Prepare detailed project description
- Include constraints upfront
- Specify technical preferences
- Define success criteria

### 2. Research Phase (35-45% tokens) - HIGHEST COST

**Cost Drivers**:
- Parallel agent execution
- Web searches and analysis
- Large document generation
- Competitive analysis

**Optimization Strategies**:

**Choose Appropriate Research Depth**:
```bash
# For MVP or proof of concept
Research depth: Minimal (1-2 hours, 5 documents)

# For funded startup
Research depth: Medium (3-5 hours, 14 documents) [DEFAULT]

# For enterprise projects
Research depth: Thorough (6-10 hours, 43 documents)
```

**Cache Research Results**:
```javascript
// AgileAiAgents automatically caches in project-state/verification-cache/
// Reuse cached data for iterations:
Market data: 24 hours retention
Company info: 7 days retention
Technical docs: 30 days retention
```

**Skip Unnecessary Research**:
```bash
# If you already have market research
You: "Skip market analysis, I have recent Gartner report"

# If building internal tool
You: "Skip competitive analysis, internal tool only"

# If technology is decided
You: "Skip technology evaluation, using Next.js and Supabase"
```

### 3. Planning Phase (10-15% tokens)

**Cost Drivers**:
- PRD generation
- Architecture design
- Sprint planning

**Optimization Strategies**:
```bash
# Reference existing patterns
"Use standard REST API patterns"
"Follow our existing microservice architecture"
"Apply company coding standards from CLAUDE.md"

# Limit iteration depth
"Generate PRD with essential features only"
"Focus on MVP architecture"
"Plan 2-week sprints maximum"
```

### 4. Implementation Phase (25-30% tokens)

**Cost Drivers**:
- Code generation
- Multiple file creation
- Testing implementation
- Debugging cycles

**Optimization Strategies**:

**Batch Operations**:
```bash
# EXPENSIVE: Individual file creation
"Create user model"
"Now create user controller"
"Now create user service"

# OPTIMIZED: Batch creation
"Create complete user module: model, controller, service, tests"
```

**Reference Patterns**:
```bash
# EXPENSIVE: Detailed implementation instructions
"Create a user authentication system with JWT tokens, refresh tokens,
password hashing with bcrypt, rate limiting, etc..."

# OPTIMIZED: Reference known patterns
"Implement standard JWT authentication following auth-pattern.md"
```

**Incremental Building**:
```bash
# Build core first
/checkpoint "Core API complete"
/compact

# Then add features
/continue
"Add advanced features..."
```

### 5. Testing & Deployment (5-10% tokens)

**Cost Drivers**:
- Test generation
- Debugging failures
- Deployment configs

**Optimization Strategies**:
```bash
# Generate tests with code
"Implement user service with comprehensive tests"

# Not separately
"Now write tests for user service"

# Use test templates
"Apply standard test patterns from testing-guide.md"
```

## Context Management Strategies

### Proactive Context Clearing

**Between Phases**:
```bash
# After research phase
/checkpoint "Research complete, 14 documents generated"
/compact

# After planning
/checkpoint "PRD and architecture approved"
/compact

# After each sprint
/checkpoint "Sprint 1 complete: Authentication implemented"
/compact
```

**Context Usage Indicators**:
```bash
# Check before expensive operations
/cost
# If approaching limits, compact first
/compact
# Then proceed
/start-sprint
```

### Smart Checkpoint Strategy

**Checkpoint Before**:
- Major phase transitions
- Expensive operations
- Context clearing
- End of work session

**Checkpoint Pattern**:
```bash
# Always include context
/checkpoint "Completed user authentication with JWT, 
            starting payment integration with Stripe"

# Not just
/checkpoint "Done with auth"
```

## Model Selection Optimization

### Choose the Right Model

**For Discovery & Planning**:
```bash
# Use Sonnet (balanced)
/model claude-3-sonnet-20240229
```

**For Simple Implementation**:
```bash
# Consider Haiku (cheaper)
/model claude-3-haiku-20240229
```

**For Complex Architecture**:
```bash
# Use Opus when needed
/model claude-3-opus-20240229
```

### Model Switching Strategy
```bash
# Start with Sonnet
/model claude-3-sonnet-20240229

# Switch to Haiku for routine code
/model claude-3-haiku-20240229
"Implement CRUD operations for all models"

# Back to Sonnet for complex logic
/model claude-3-sonnet-20240229
"Implement the recommendation algorithm"
```

## AgileAiAgents-Specific Optimizations

### 1. JSON Loading (80-90% Savings)
```javascript
// Agents automatically load JSON
// Ensure this is working:
ls machine-data/project-documents-json/

// If empty, manually trigger:
node machine-data/document-json-generator.js
```

### 2. Parallel vs Sequential Agent Execution
```yaml
# In CLAUDE.md - for cost-sensitive projects
agent_execution:
  mode: "sequential"  # Reduces parallel token usage
  max_parallel: 2     # Limit concurrent agents
```

### 3. Document Generation Limits
```yaml
# Limit document sizes
document_limits:
  max_research_docs: 10      # Instead of 43
  max_doc_size_kb: 50        # Prevent huge documents
  summary_only: true         # Generate summaries vs full docs
```

### 4. Sprint Size Optimization
```bash
# Smaller sprints = more compacting opportunities
"Plan 1-week sprints"  # More compact points
# vs
"Plan 4-week sprints"  # Context accumulation
```

## Cost Reduction Workflows

### Workflow 1: Rapid Prototyping
```bash
# 1. Minimal research
Research depth: Minimal

# 2. Skip non-essential analysis
Skip: Competitive analysis, market sizing, financial projections

# 3. Focus on core features
"MVP with 3 key features only"

# 4. Fast implementation
/model claude-3-haiku-20240229
"Generate basic implementation"

# Total: ~$15-20 per prototype
```

### Workflow 2: Research-Only Projects
```bash
# 1. Research without implementation
/research-only

# 2. Compact after each section
[After competitors] /compact
[After market] /compact
[After technical] /compact

# 3. Export and exit
/export
/exit

# Total: ~$8-12 per research project
```

### Workflow 3: Incremental Development
```bash
# 1. Build in small increments
Sprint 1: Authentication only
/compact

Sprint 2: Core features only
/compact

Sprint 3: Advanced features
/compact

# Total: Better cost distribution
```

## Advanced Cost Management

### Daily Budget Limits
```bash
# Set mental limit
Daily budget: $10

# Check periodically
/cost
# If > $8, wrap up for day
/checkpoint "Daily limit approaching"
```

### Project Cost Tracking
```bash
# Start of project
echo "Project: TaskManager" > costs.log
echo "Day 1 Start: $0.00" >> costs.log

# End of each day
/cost
echo "Day 1 End: $8.47" >> costs.log

# Calculate totals
cat costs.log | grep "End:" | awk '{sum += $4} END {print "Total: $" sum}'
```

### Team Cost Management
```bash
# Shared research cache
project-state/verification-cache/  # Shared folder

# Avoid duplicate research
"Check cache first before new research"

# Sequential development
Developer 1: Research + Planning ($12)
Developer 2: Implementation (uses cache) ($6)
# Total: $18 vs $24 if both did everything
```

## Common Cost Pitfalls

### 1. Conversation Loops
```bash
# EXPENSIVE: Circular discussions
"That's not quite right"
"OK, how about this?"
"Still not right"
[... repeats 10x ...]

# SOLUTION: Clear examples
"Here's exactly what I need: [example]"
```

### 2. Regenerating Everything
```bash
# EXPENSIVE: Start over
"Delete everything and start fresh"

# OPTIMIZED: Incremental fixes
"Update only the authentication module"
```

### 3. Debug Loops
```bash
# EXPENSIVE: Trial and error
"Try fixing the error"
"Still broken, try again"
"Try something else"

# OPTIMIZED: Diagnostic first
"Run diagnostics and show me the error details"
[Analyze root cause]
"Fix the specific issue in auth.js line 47"
```

### 4. Unfocused Research
```bash
# EXPENSIVE: Research everything
"Research all possible solutions"

# OPTIMIZED: Targeted research
"Research JWT vs Session auth for our Node.js API"
```

## Cost Optimization Checklist

### Daily Practices
- [ ] Check `/cost` at start of session
- [ ] Set daily budget limit
- [ ] Use `/compact` between major tasks
- [ ] Monitor token usage every 2-3 hours
- [ ] Checkpoint before ending session

### Project Practices
- [ ] Choose appropriate research depth
- [ ] Skip unnecessary analysis
- [ ] Batch related operations
- [ ] Use cached research when available
- [ ] Build incrementally with compacting

### Team Practices
- [ ] Share research cache
- [ ] Coordinate to avoid duplicate work
- [ ] Document decisions to avoid re-research
- [ ] Use consistent patterns (reduce variance)
- [ ] Review costs weekly

## ROI Considerations

### Cost vs Value
```
Traditional Development:
- Developer: $500-800/day
- Time to MVP: 4-6 weeks
- Total: $10,000-24,000

With AgileAiAgents:
- AI costs: $50-100/week
- Developer: $500-800/day (reduced hours)
- Time to MVP: 1-2 weeks
- Total: $3,000-8,000

Savings: 60-70% cost reduction
```

### When to Invest in Higher Costs
- **Enterprise projects**: Thorough research worth extra $50-100
- **Complex architecture**: Opus model worth extra $20-30/day
- **Production systems**: Comprehensive testing worth extra tokens
- **Investor demos**: Polish and documentation worth the cost

### When to Minimize Costs
- **Prototypes**: Use minimal research, Haiku model
- **Internal tools**: Skip market research, competitive analysis
- **Learning projects**: Use sequential execution, small sprints
- **Experiments**: Aggressive compacting, minimal documentation

## Summary

Effective cost optimization in AgileAiAgents involves:

1. **Understanding cost drivers** - Research phase is most expensive
2. **Proactive monitoring** - Regular `/cost` checks
3. **Smart context management** - Strategic `/compact` usage
4. **Appropriate depth selection** - Match research to project needs
5. **Team coordination** - Share resources and avoid duplication

Remember: The goal is not to minimize costs at all expense, but to maximize value per dollar spent. AgileAiAgents already provides 60-70% cost savings over traditional development - these optimizations help you maximize that advantage.
