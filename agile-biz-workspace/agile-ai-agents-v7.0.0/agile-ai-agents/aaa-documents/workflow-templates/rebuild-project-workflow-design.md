# Rebuild Project Workflow Design (Discussion Document)

## Overview
This design document outlines the `/rebuild-project-workflow` that handles projects after the decision to rebuild has been made. This workflow incorporates ALL phases from both new-project and existing-project workflows, enhanced for rebuild scenarios, plus operations phases for long-term success.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Side-by-Side Architecture
- **Rebuild Folder**: `rebuilt-[original-name]/` created alongside original
- **Documentation**: All docs stay in `agile-ai-agents/project-documents/`
- **Sprint Naming**: `sprint-YYYY-MM-DD-rebuild-[feature]`
- **State Management**: Separate state tracking for rebuild vs original

### 2. Parallel Operation Support
- Original system continues running during rebuild
- Gradual migration of users/data
- Feature parity tracking
- Dual monitoring dashboards

### 3. Enhanced Approval Gates
- More frequent stakeholder checkpoints (every 2-3 phases)
- Risk assessment at each gate
- Go/pause/pivot options throughout
- Clear rollback strategies

## Command Structure
```
/rebuild-project-workflow                    # Full workflow with all phases
/rebuild-project-workflow --type=[type]      # Specify rebuild type
/rebuild-project-workflow --resume           # Resume from checkpoint  
/rebuild-project-workflow --status           # Current phase and progress
/rebuild-project-workflow --comparison       # Compare old vs new systems
/rebuild-project-workflow --migration-status # Data migration progress
```

    "rebuild_type": "technical|partial|business_model|complete",
    "workflow_phase": "[current_phase]",
    "parallel_operation": true|false,
    "original_system_status": "active|standby|retired",
    "rebuild_system_status": "building|testing|active"
  }
}
```

### 2. Documentation Strategy
- **Separate Rebuild Section**: `project-documents/rebuild/`
- **Comparison Docs**: Always show old vs new
- **Migration Guides**: Step-by-step procedures
- **Rollback Plans**: At every phase
- **Lessons Learned**: Continuous capture

### 3. Risk Management

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Sprint Duration**: Should rebuild sprints be shorter (2-3 days) for more agility?

2. **Parallel Duration**: How long should both systems run in parallel by default?

3. **Approval Gates**: Are 5-6 gates too many? Should we add more?

4. **Documentation**: Should we maintain THREE sets (old, new, comparison)?

5. **Feature Parity**: Should 100% parity be required or can we drop features?

6. **Team Structure**: Should we have dedicated rebuild team or rotate?

7. **Testing Strategy**: How much testing before cutover? User acceptance testing?

8. **Rollback Timeline**: How long keep rollback option after cutover?

9. **Cost Tracking**: Should we track rebuild ROI in real-time?

10. **Learning Capture**: How to best capture rebuild learnings for community?

**Note**: This is a discussion document for the `/rebuild-project-workflow` design. It incorporates all phases from both new-project and existing-project workflows, enhanced for rebuild scenarios, plus comprehensive operations phases for long-term success.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Side-by-side deployment (original + rebuilt)
- Sprint naming follows convention (not "Sprint 0")
- Documentation stays in agile-ai-agents
- More frequent approval gates
- Parallel operations duration from stakeholder interview
- Complete workflow from discovery through legacy retirement
