# New Project Workflow Template

## Overview
This template guides the `/start-new-project-workflow` command through a structured discovery, research, and implementation process with sequential phases and approval gates.

## Command Options
- `/start-new-project-workflow` - Run complete workflow (all phases sequentially)
- `/start-new-project-workflow --status` - Show current phase and progress
- `/start-new-project-workflow --resume` - Resume from last checkpoint
- `/start-new-project-workflow --save-state` - Save current progress mid-phase
- `/start-new-project-workflow --dry-run` - Preview workflow phases without executing
- `/start-new-project-workflow --parallel` - Enable parallel agent execution where applicable

## Workflow Phases

2. Validate and score the file
3. Display quality score and feedback
4. Review each section progressively with confirmation
5. Skip to Section 0 for any missing critical information
