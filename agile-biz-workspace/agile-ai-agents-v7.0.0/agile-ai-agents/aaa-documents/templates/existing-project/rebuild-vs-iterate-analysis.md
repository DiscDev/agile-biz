| Migration | $[X] | [Z] weeks | [Customer count] |
| Opportunity Cost | $[X] | During rebuild | Lost revenue |
| Risk Buffer | $[X] | 30% of total | Contingency |
| **Total** | **$[X]** | **[Y] months** | |

### Rebuild Benefits (3-Year)
| Benefit | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Maintenance Savings | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] |
| New Revenue Enabled | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] |

| **Total** | **$[X]** | **$[X]** | **$[X]** | **$[X]** |

### ROI Calculation
```
Total Benefits: $[X]
Total Costs: $[Y]
ROI = ((Benefits - Costs) / Costs) × 100 = [Z]%
Payback Period: [X] months
```

## Iterate Alternative Analysis

### What We Could Fix Incrementally
| Issue | Fix Effort | Timeline | Impact |
|-------|------------|----------|--------|
| [Issue 1] | [Hours] | [Weeks] | [Limited/Moderate/High] |
| [Issue 2] | [Hours] | [Weeks] | [Limited/Moderate/High] |

### Iterate Costs (Ongoing)
| Category | Monthly | Annual | 3-Year |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Maintenance | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] |
| Workarounds | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] |
| Lost Opportunities | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] |
| Technical Debt Interest | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] |
| **Total** | **$[X]** | **$[X]** | **$[X]** |

### Why Iteration Falls Short
1. **Cannot achieve scale**: Current architecture caps at [X] users
2. **Security vulnerabilities**: Core design flaws unfixable
3. **Velocity degradation**: Each change takes [X]% longer
4. **Market window closing**: Competitors gaining [X]% monthly

## Risk Assessment

### Rebuild Risks
