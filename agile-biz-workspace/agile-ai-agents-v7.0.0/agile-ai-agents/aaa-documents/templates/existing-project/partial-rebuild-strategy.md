### Keep vs Rebuild Criteria

#### Components to Keep
✅ **Criteria Met**:
- Technical debt <30%
- Well-documented
- Good test coverage
- No security issues
- Meets performance needs

**Components**:
1. **Authentication System**
   - Why keep: Recently updated, OAuth2 compliant
   - Integration points: 5 touchpoints
   - Wrapper needed: Yes, for new API format

2. **API Gateway**
   - Why keep: Stateless, well-designed
   - Integration points: All external
   - Wrapper needed: No

#### Components to Rebuild
❌ **Rebuild Triggers**:
- Technical debt >60%
- Core security flaws
- Performance bottleneck
- Unmaintainable code
- Blocking new features

**Components**:
1. **Core Business Logic**
   - Why rebuild: Tightly coupled, untestable
   - Dependencies: Database, Reports
   - New approach: Microservice with events

2. **Database Layer**
   - Why rebuild: No abstraction, SQL injection risks
   - Dependencies: All components
   - New approach: Repository pattern with ORM

## Integration Approach

### Strangler Fig Implementation

#### Phase 1: Facade Creation
```
[Old System] ← [Facade Layer] → [New Components]
                     ↓
              [Router/Proxy]
                     ↓
                 [Clients]
```

1. Create facade interface
2. Route all traffic through facade
3. Implement monitoring
4. Set up feature flags

#### Phase 2: Component Migration
**Month 1-2: Database Layer**
```javascript
// Old way (direct SQL)
db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId);

// New way (repository pattern)
userRepository.findById(userId);
```

**Month 3-4: Business Logic**
```javascript
// Old way (monolithic)
processOrder(order, user, inventory, payment);

// New way (event-driven)
orderService.process(order);
// Publishes events for other services
```

#### Phase 3: Gradual Cutover
- Week 1: 10% traffic to new components
- Week 2: 25% traffic
- Week 3: 50% traffic
- Week 4: 100% traffic
- Week 5: Deprecate old components

### Dependency Management

#### Breaking Dependencies
| Coupled Components | Decoupling Strategy | Timeline |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Business ↔ Database | Repository pattern | Month 1 |
| Reports ↔ Database | Read replica + API | Month 2 |
| Frontend ↔ Backend | GraphQL layer | Month 3 |
| Users ↔ Auth | Token-based auth | Month 4 |

#### New Integration Patterns
1. **Event-Driven**: Components publish events
2. **API-First**: All communication via APIs
3. **Service Mesh**: For microservice communication
4. **Message Queue**: For async processing

| Feature gaps | Feature flags | Fallback to old code |

### Parallel Operation Strategy
1. **Both systems run simultaneously**
2. **Traffic routing via feature flags**
3. **Data sync via event streaming**
4. **Monitoring for discrepancies**
5. **30-day parallel operation minimum**

## Resource Requirements

### Team Structure
| Role | Allocation | Focus Area |
|------|------------|------------|
| Tech Lead | 100% | Architecture & coordination |
| Backend Dev 1 | 100% | Database & core logic |
| Backend Dev 2 | 100% | Reports & APIs |
| Frontend Dev | 50% | UI updates |
| DevOps | 50% | Infrastructure & deployment |
| QA | 75% | Testing both systems |

### Skillset Requirements
- **Critical**: Experience with strangler pattern
- **Important**: Microservices knowledge
- **Helpful**: Event-driven architecture

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
1. **Unit tests**: Each new component
2. **Integration tests**: Between old/new
3. **Contract tests**: API compatibility
4. **Performance tests**: No degradation
5. **Regression tests**: Existing features work

### Compatibility Testing Matrix
| Old Component | New Component | Test Type | Status |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Old DB | New Repository | Integration | [ ] |
| Old API | New API | Contract | [ ] |
| Old Frontend | New Backend | E2E | [ ] |
| Old Reports | New Reports | Comparison | [ ] |

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- [ ] Zero regression in functionality

## Rollback Strategy

### Component-Level Rollback
Each component can be rolled back independently:
1. Flip feature flag to old component
2. Stop new component
3. Investigate issues
4. Fix and redeploy
5. Try again with smaller cohort

### Full Rollback Criteria
If 3+ components fail or critical issue:
1. Revert all feature flags
2. Route all traffic to old system
3. Maintain new components (no data loss)
4. Root cause analysis
5. Revised approach

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Updates
- **Weekly**: Progress on current component
- **Bi-weekly**: Overall program status
- **Monthly**: Metrics and ROI
- **Per component**: Go-live notification

### Customer Communication
- Minimal communication needed (transparent migration)
- Performance improvements announced
- New features highlighted
- No downtime expected
