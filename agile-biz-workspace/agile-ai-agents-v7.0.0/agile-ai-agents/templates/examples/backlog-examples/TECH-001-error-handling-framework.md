**ID**: TECH-001
**Epic**: Technical Debt
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Ready
**Story Points**: 8
**Sprint**: Not Assigned

## User Story
As a developer,
I want a consistent error handling framework across the application,
So that errors are properly caught, logged, and presented to users appropriately.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Global error handler catches all unhandled exceptions
- [ ] Errors are categorized (user, system, network, validation)
- [ ] Each error has a unique code for tracking
- [ ] User-friendly messages displayed for all error types
- [ ] Technical details logged but not exposed to users
- [ ] Errors are reported to monitoring service
- [ ] Recovery suggestions provided where applicable
- [ ] Errors don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] API errors follow consistent format
- [ ] Frontend gracefully handles all error states

## Technical Requirements
- Create centralized error classes
- Implement error boundary components (React)
- Set up structured logging with levels
- Create error translation service
- Implement retry logic for transient errors
- Set up error monitoring integration
- Create error documentation
- Implement circuit breaker pattern

## Dependencies
- Logging infrastructure must be in place
- Monitoring service must be selected
- API standards must be defined

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Error handling implemented across all layers
- [ ] Unit tests cover error scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify error flow
- [ ] Documentation complete with examples
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard configured
- [ ] Team trained on error handling patterns
- [ ] Error budget defined and tracked
- [ ] Performance impact measured

## Notes
- Consider implementing error budget SLOs
- Plan for internationalization of error messages
- May need custom errors for business logic
