# AI-Native Sprint Pulse Updates

## Overview
This folder contains event-driven pulse updates generated by the Scrum Master Agent during sprint execution. Unlike traditional daily standups, these pulses are triggered by significant events and progress milestones, reflecting the continuous nature of AI agent operations.

## Pulse Naming Convention
```
pulse-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[event-type].md
```

Example: `pulse-2025-01-09-093045-story-done.md`

## Event Types

### Always Trigger Pulse
- `sprint-start` - Sprint initiated
- `sprint-complete` - Sprint finished
- `story-done` - Story completed
- `blocker-new` - Impediment detected
- `blocker-resolved` - Impediment cleared
- `milestone-10pct` - 10% progress reached
- `milestone-20pct` - 20% progress reached (etc.)
- `phase-transition` - Sprint phase change
- `critical-event` - Critical failure or issue
- `scope-change` - Sprint scope modified

### Batched Events
- `batch-update` - Collection of minor events within 60 seconds

## Pulse Structure
Each pulse contains:
- Trigger event
- Current sprint progress
- Active work in progress
- Completed items since last pulse
- Current velocity
- Key events description
- Active blockers/risks
- Next planned actions

## Rate Limiting
- Minimum 10 seconds between pulses
- Minor events batched for 60 seconds
- Critical events bypass rate limits

## Benefits Over Daily Standups
1. **Real-time Updates**: Events reported as they happen
2. **Event-Driven**: Only generate updates when something significant occurs
3. **AI-Speed Native**: No artificial time constraints
4. **Complete History**: Every significant event captured
5. **Searchable**: Event types in filenames enable quick filtering

## Usage
The Scrum Master Agent automatically generates these pulses based on sprint activity. Stakeholders can monitor sprint progress by reviewing recent pulses or searching for specific event types.
