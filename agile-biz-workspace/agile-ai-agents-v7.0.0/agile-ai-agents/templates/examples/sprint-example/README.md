# Sprint YYYY-MM-DD: Feature Name - Example Structure

## Overview
This is a comprehensive example sprint folder showing the complete structure and documentation that should be created for every sprint in the AgileAiAgents system.

## Folder Purposes

### `/planning`
Contains all sprint planning documents including selected backlog items, sprint goals, and capacity planning. Created during sprint planning ceremony.

### `/daily-updates`
Houses daily standup notes tracking progress, blockers, and decisions. One file per day during the sprint.

### `/retrospectives`
Sprint retrospective findings and action items for continuous improvement. Created at sprint end.

### `/reviews`
Sprint review presentations, demos, and stakeholder feedback. Documents sprint outcomes and acceptance.

### `/testing`
Test plans, test cases, and test execution results specific to this sprint.

### `/documents`
Flexible space for any additional sprint-specific documentation that doesn't fit the standard structure.

### `state.md`
Tracks sprint lifecycle: planning → active → testing → review → retrospective → completed → archived

## Key Documents

### Selected Backlog Items
Lists all user stories selected for the sprint with point estimates and assignments.

### Sprint Goal
Clear, measurable objective for what the sprint will achieve.

### Capacity Planning
Team capacity calculation and point allocation per agent.

### Daily Standups
Progress updates, blockers, and key decisions from daily coordination.

### Sprint Retrospective
What went well, what needs improvement, and action items.

### Sprint Review
Demonstration results, stakeholder feedback, and acceptance status.

### Test Results
Comprehensive testing outcomes with coverage metrics and bug reports.

## Sprint Lifecycle

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Create sprint folder structure
   - Select backlog items
   - Define sprint goal
   - Plan capacity

2. **Active Phase**
   - Daily standup updates
   - Progress tracking
   - Blocker management
   - Continuous integration

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Execute test plan
   - Document results
   - Fix critical issues

4. **Review Phase**
   - Demonstrate completed work
   - Collect stakeholder feedback
   - Update product backlog

5. **Retrospective Phase**
   - Team reflection
   - Identify improvements
   - Create action items

6. **Completion Phase**
   - Archive sprint
   - Update velocity metrics
   - Carry over incomplete items

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Use this structure for every sprint
2. **Timeliness**: Update documents in real-time, not retroactively
3. **Completeness**: Every sprint should have all folders, even if some are light
4. **Clarity**: Write for future reference and new team members
5. **Integration**: Link to product backlog items and project documentation

## Using as a Template

To create a new sprint:
1. Copy this entire folder structure
2. Rename to `sprint-YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name`
3. Clear example content but keep structure
4. Update state.md to "planning"
5. Begin sprint planning activities

This example sprint demonstrates the comprehensive documentation and organization expected for successful sprint execution in the AgileAiAgents system.
