# Stakeholder Prompt Templates

## Overview

The Stakeholder Prompt Template system helps you provide comprehensive project information before starting your AgileAiAgents workflow. By preparing thoughtful answers in advance, you'll get better project outcomes and save significant time during the discovery process.

## Quick Start

1. **Choose Your Template**:
   - [New Project Template](universal-project-prompt.md) - For brand new projects
   - [Existing Project Template](existing-project-prompt.md) - For enhancing current systems

3. **Fill Out Your Template**:
   - Use Google Docs for collaboration ([Export Guide](google-docs-export-guide.md))
   - Or edit directly in Markdown
   - Aim for quality score of 70+ ([Scoring Rubric](prompt-quality-rubric.md))

4. **Save Your File**:
   ```
