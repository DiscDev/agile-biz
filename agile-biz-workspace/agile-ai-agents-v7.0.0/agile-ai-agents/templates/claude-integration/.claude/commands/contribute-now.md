#### 3. Code Example Development

**Performance Monitoring Component**:
```javascript
// Custom hook for performance monitoring
import { useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';

const usePerformanceMonitor = (componentName) => {
  const startTime = performance.now();

  const logRenderTime = useCallback(() => {
    const endTime = performance.now();
    const renderTime = endTime - startTime;
    
    if (renderTime > 16) { // Longer than one frame
      console.warn(`${componentName} render took ${renderTime.toFixed(2)}ms`);
    }
  }, [componentName, startTime]);

  useEffect(() => {
    logRenderTime();
  });

  return { startTime, logRenderTime };
};

// Usage in optimized component
const OptimizedDashboard = React.memo(({ data, filters }) => {
  usePerformanceMonitor('OptimizedDashboard');
  
  // Memoize expensive calculations
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return data.filter(item => 
      filters.category === 'all' || item.category === filters.category
    ).map(item => ({
      ...item,
      score: calculateComplexScore(item) // Expensive calculation
    }));
  }, [data, filters.category]);

  // Memoize event handlers to prevent child re-renders
  const handleItemClick = useCallback((itemId) => {
    // Handle click logic
    onItemSelect(itemId);
  }, [onItemSelect]);

  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
        <LazyChart data={processedData} onClick={handleItemClick} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
});

export default OptimizedDashboard;
```

**Bundle Splitting Configuration**:
```javascript
// webpack.config.js - Strategic code splitting
module.exports = {
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
      cacheGroups: {
        // Separate vendor libraries
        vendor: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
          name: 'vendors',
          priority: 10,
          reuseExistingChunk: true,
        },
        // Separate common utilities
        common: {
          name: 'common',
          minChunks: 2,
          priority: 5,
          reuseExistingChunk: true,
        },
        // Large libraries get their own chunks
        lodash: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]lodash[\\/]/,
          name: 'lodash',
          priority: 15,
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

// Dynamic imports for route-based splitting
const DashboardPage = lazy(() => 
  import('./pages/DashboardPage').then(module => ({
    default: module.DashboardPage
  }))
);

const AnalyticsPage = lazy(() => 
  import('./pages/AnalyticsPage')
);
```
