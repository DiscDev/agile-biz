# Continue Working

Resume work from the last saved state or a specific sprint.

## Check Arguments

If $ARGUMENTS contains a sprint name, resume that specific sprint.
Otherwise, resume from the most recent workflow state.

## Resume Process

1. **Load State**
   - Read `project-state/workflow-state.json`
   - Identify current phase and progress
   - Load any pending tasks or decisions

2. **Context Restoration**
   - Display brief summary of where we left off
   - Show pending tasks or blockers
   - List available next actions

3. **Resume Workflow**
   - For new project workflow: Continue from current phase
   - For existing project: Resume analysis or implementation
   - For sprint work: Load sprint state and continue tasks

## State Detection

Check for various state indicators:
- Active workflow phase
- Pending approval gates
- In-progress sprints
- Unfinished research
- Incomplete documentation

## Output Format

```
