### Implementation Details

**Architecture Approach**:
```javascript
// JWT Token Structure
{
  "userId": "uuid-v4",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "user|admin|guest",
  "permissions": ["read:profile", "write:profile"],
  "iat": 1674123456,
  "exp": 1674209856
}

// Middleware Stack
app.use('/api/auth', [
  rateLimiter,           // 5 requests per minute per IP
  inputValidator,        // Joi schema validation
  sanitizer,            // XSS protection
  authController        // Main auth logic
]);
```

**Key Components Created**:
- `AuthController` - Handles registration, login, password reset
- `JWTService` - Token generation, validation, refresh logic
- `RoleMiddleware` - RBAC enforcement for protected routes
- `PasswordService` - Secure password hashing and validation
- `EmailService` - Registration and password reset emails

**Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Users table with authentication fields
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'user',
  email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  reset_token VARCHAR(255),
  reset_token_expires TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Sessions table for token blacklisting
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  token_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Quality Metrics Achieved

**Testing Coverage**: 94%
- Unit tests: 87 tests covering all controller methods
- Integration tests: 23 tests for complete auth flows
- Security tests: 12 tests for common vulnerabilities
- Performance tests: Load testing up to 1000 concurrent users

**Performance Benchmarks**:
| Endpoint | Target | Achieved | Status |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| POST /register | <300ms | 185ms | ✅ |
| POST /login | <200ms | 145ms | ✅ |
| GET /profile | <100ms | 67ms | ✅ |
| POST /reset | <250ms | 198ms | ✅ |

**Security Validation** ✅
- OWASP Top 10 compliance verified
- Penetration testing completed (no critical issues)
- Password strength requirements enforced
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Input validation prevents injection attacks

### Technical Learnings and Insights

**Key Technical Discoveries**:
1. **JWT Refresh Strategy**: Implemented sliding session approach
   - Access tokens: 15-minute expiry
   - Refresh tokens: 7-day expiry with rotation
   - Reduced security risk while maintaining user experience

2. **Password Hashing Optimization**: bcrypt cost factor tuning
   - Cost factor 12 provided optimal security/performance balance
   - Hashing time: ~250ms (acceptable for login flow)
   - Prevents timing attacks with consistent response times

3. **Role-Based Permissions**: Granular permission system
   - Permissions stored as array in JWT for fast access checks
   - Database lookup only on token generation/refresh
   - Supports complex permission hierarchies without performance impact

**Process Insights**:
- **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests first caught 3 edge cases early
- **Security Review**: External security review found 2 minor issues, fixed before completion
- **API Design**: REST conventions improved integration with frontend team
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI spec generation saved 4+ hours of manual documentation

**Performance Optimizations**:
```javascript
// Connection pooling for database queries
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionLimit: 20,
  acquireTimeout: 60000,
  timeout: 60000,
});

// Redis caching for user sessions
const cacheUserSession = async (userId, sessionData) => {
  await redis.setex(`session:${userId}`, 900, JSON.stringify(sessionData));
};

// Async password validation to prevent blocking
const validatePassword = async (plaintext, hash) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    bcrypt.compare(plaintext, hash, (err, result) => {
      resolve(!err && result);
    });
  });
};
```

### Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1: Email Verification Flow**

### Technical Implementation Details

**Indexing Strategy Implemented**:
```sql
-- Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_products_category_status_price 
ON products(category_id, status, price) 
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Full-text search optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_products_search_vector 
ON products USING gin(search_vector);

SELECT p.*, c.name as category_name 
FROM products p 
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id 
WHERE p.status = 'active' 
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;

-- After: Optimized with better join strategy
WITH active_products AS (
  SELECT id, name, category_id, price, created_at
  FROM products 
  WHERE status = 'active'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 100
)
SELECT ap.*, c.name as category_name
