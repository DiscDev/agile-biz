Complete registry of all 83 commands with metadata and categories.

## Statusline Features

The real-time statusline at the bottom of Claude Code shows:

- üü¢üü°üî¥ **Health Status**: Project health indicators

- üë• **Active Agents**: Running agents with efficiency metrics (45-75% faster)
- üí∞ **Cost Tracking**: Session cost and token usage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Action Alerts**: Stakeholder actions with urgency countdown
- üîß **Recovery Status**: Active during issue resolution

### Example Displays:
```
üü¢ Sprint 1 | 3/5 stories | 2 agents (45% faster) | $2.34
‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION NEEDED | Create GitHub repo | 5m until blocked
üî¥ ALERT | 3 blockers | Token 87% | Recovery active

- `/quickstart` - Interactive menu with all options

### State & Progress
- `/aaa-status` - Complete context summary
- `/continue` - Resume from last saved state
- `/checkpoint` - Create manual checkpoint
- `/sprint-status` - Current sprint progress

### Development
- `/implement` - Task implementation assistance
- `/generate-code` - AI code generation
- `/review-code` - Automated code review
- `/debug` - Debugging assistance

### Research & Documentation
- `/research-only` - Market research
- `/generate-prd` - Product requirements document
- `/generate-pitch-deck` - Investor presentation

## Troubleshooting

### Statusline Not Appearing
```bash
chmod +x .claude/hooks/statusline.sh
```

### Clear Cache
```bash
rm .claude/hooks/.statusline-cache
```

### Test Hook
```bash
echo '{"currentWorkingDirectory":"$(pwd)"}' | .claude/hooks/statusline.sh
```

### Hooks Not Working
1. Ensure all hooks are executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh`
2. Check settings.json has correct paths (should have your actual path, not {{USER_PATH}})
3. Verify hooks are enabled in settings.local.json

## Important Notes

- This is a **hidden directory** (starts with `.`)
  - Mac: Press `Cmd+Shift+.` in Finder to show
  - Windows: Enable "Show hidden files" in File Explorer
  - Linux: Use `ls -la` or enable in file manager

- The `settings.json` file will have `{{USER_PATH}}` placeholders until you run the setup script

- All hooks require executable permissions (handled by setup)

- Commands work immediately after setup - no additional configuration needed

## Support

- **All Commands**: Type `/aaa-help` for complete list
- **Documentation**: See `CLAUDE.md` in project root
- **Issues**: Check the troubleshooting section above
